# Build 181 handoff note — verified provider quote deposits

Build 181 adds verified Stripe/PayPal webhook settlement for accepted quote deposit/payment requests. Apply `sql/2026-05-26_build181_payment_webhooks_quote_deposits.sql` after Build 180, then test Stripe Checkout metadata settlement and PayPal verified capture settlement through `quote_deposit_payment_requests`.

# Build 178 update — Status Saves, Saved Price Reviews, Public Content Rendering & Privacy Badges

**Current build:** Build 178  
**Date:** 2026-05-25

Build 178 closes the next operational gaps after Build 177 by adding conversion-draft status saving, saved final price reviews, live rendering of Admin Content Center blocks on public pages, media privacy readiness badges in the Social Queue/App Management flow, and deeper local SEO proof recommendations. No new DDL is required; this pass depends on the Build 175 content/conversion tables and Build 177 final-price review fields.

## Completed in Build 178

1. Added `/api/admin/lead_conversion_status_save` so staff can move conversion drafts through `draft_booking`, `needs_review`, `ready_to_book`, `converted`, and `closed`.
2. Added `/api/admin/lead_conversion_price_review_save` so catalog reconciliation results can be saved before booking creation.
3. Updated `/admin-conversions.html` with Save Status and Save Price Review controls.
4. Added `/assets/public-content-blocks.js` and live public content mounts on Home, Services, Specials, Fleet, Maintenance, and Help pages.
5. Added Social Queue media privacy readiness badges using the existing media privacy summary endpoint.
6. Expanded local SEO proof reporting with concrete next-proof recommendations by town/service.
7. Added a Build 178 release guard and no-DDL SQL note.

## Updated completion status after Build 178

| Area | Status | Build 178 notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conversion draft status workflow | Stronger foundation | Status can now be saved without creating a booking. |
| Final price reconciliation | Stronger foundation | Reconciliation can be saved before booking creation. |
| Admin Content public rendering | Added foundation | DB/fallback content blocks can now render on public pages. |
| Media privacy before reuse | Stronger foundation | Social/Admin flows now show privacy readiness reminders. |
| Local SEO proof reporting | Stronger foundation | Report now recommends next town/service proof to create. |

## Remaining priority after Build 178

1. Add a fuller conversion-draft detail page with audit history.
2. Render saved content blocks into exact page sections rather than only generic cards.
3. Add admin approval gates that block publish/API actions unless consent and privacy statuses are approved.
4. Turn proof recommendations into assignable content/media tasks.
5. Add quote/proposal email delivery and customer acceptance tracking.

# Build 177 update — Conversion Review Queue, Price Reconciliation & Local Proof Reporting

**Updated:** 2026-05-25  
**Current build:** Build 177  
**Primary source of truth:** `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

Build 177 closes the next workflow gap after Build 176 by adding a dedicated `/admin-conversions.html` review queue. Staff can now review all lead conversion drafts in one place, reconcile final package/add-on/travel/HST pricing from the pricing catalog, confirm the required booking fields, and create a live booking only after the draft is ready. Build 177 also adds local SEO proof reporting that counts only privacy-approved before/after examples by town and service.

## Completed in Build 177

1. Added `/admin-conversions.html` and `/admin-conversions/` as a protected conversion-draft review queue.
2. Added `/api/admin/lead_conversion_price_reconcile` for catalog-backed package/add-on/travel/HST/deposit review before booking creation.
3. Added `/api/admin/local_seo_proof_report` for privacy-approved town/service proof coverage reporting.
4. Updated Admin Analytics with a **Local SEO proof coverage** card.
5. Updated public Gallery cards with clearer consent/privacy badges.
6. Added optional final-price review fields to `public.lead_conversion_drafts` via `sql/2026-05-25_build177_conversion_review_price_local_proof.sql`.
7. Updated Admin Dashboard, Admin Menu, Admin Shell, and Admin Leads access paths so the Conversion Queue is easy to find.
8. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`, `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md`, and release guards.

## Updated completion status after Build 177

| COMPETETIVE.md area | Current status | Build 177 notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lead → booking workflow | Stronger foundation | Dedicated review queue now separates draft review from the lead card UI. |
| Final price reconciliation | Added foundation | Catalog-backed package/add-on/travel/HST review is available before creating a real booking. |
| Quote/booking status workflow | Improved | Conversion drafts can be filtered/reviewed before becoming live booking rows. |
| Admin-managed content | Partial but improved | FAQ and reusable content blocks exist; page-specific live rendering remains next. |
| Service/town proof reporting | Added foundation | Analytics now reports approved proof coverage by target town/service. |
| Media privacy enforcement | Improved | Public Gallery shows consent/privacy badges and still filters non-approved media. |
| Conversion analytics | Improved | Lead/quote summary exists and local proof coverage was added to Admin Analytics. |

## Remaining competitive gap priority after Build 177

1. Save final price reconciliation payloads directly from `/admin-conversions.html` before booking creation.
2. Add a dedicated conversion-draft status update endpoint for `needs_review`, `ready_to_book`, `converted`, and `closed`.
3. Add visible privacy badges beside every admin gallery/social publish action, not only public gallery and App Management warnings.
4. Render Admin Content Center blocks live on public Specials, service, homepage, fleet, maintenance, and Help pages.
5. Add town/service proof dashboards that recommend the next local page or gallery item to create.
6. Add customer-facing quote/proposal send and acceptance tracking.

---

# Build 174 update — Admin Leads quote/proposal drafts

**Updated:** 2026-05-24  
**Current build:** Build 174  
**Primary source of truth:** `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

Build 174 completes the next open competitive-matrix item after the quote starter: staff can now save generated quote starter text as a persistent quote/proposal draft from `/admin-leads.html`. This moves the workflow from copy-only follow-up toward a real quote pipeline while staying fallback-safe if the new table has not been applied yet.

## Completed in Build 174

1. Added `/api/admin/quote_proposal_drafts_save` for staff-protected quote/proposal draft creation and updates.
2. Added `/api/admin/quote_proposal_drafts_list` for staff-protected draft lookup by lead, booking, status, search, or id.
3. Updated `/admin-leads.html` and `/admin-leads/index.html` with **Save quote draft** and **Load drafts** actions on each public lead.
4. Added persistent draft display directly under the lead card so staff can see saved follow-up text before contacting a customer.
5. Added migration-safe fallback messages when the new draft table has not been applied yet.
6. Added SQL migration `sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql`.
7. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` and `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md` with the quote/proposal draft table plan.
8. Added release guard `scripts/quote_proposal_drafts_build174_check.py` and wired it into `scripts/release_check.py`.
9. Re-ran Cloudflare Functions checks, one-H1 validation, and release checks.

## Active next steps after Build 174

1. Apply `sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql` after the Build 167/168 lead SQL.
2. Browser-test `/admin-leads.html` by building a quote starter, saving it as a draft, and loading it again.
3. Add draft status controls for `needs_review`, `ready_to_send`, `sent`, `accepted`, and `declined`.
4. Add one-click lead → draft booking/quote conversion.
5. Add package/add-on price suggestions from the live pricing catalog.
6. Extend Admin Content Center to specials, service blurbs, homepage cards, and help articles.
7. Add service/town-aware proof filtering and media privacy enforcement before public gallery/social use.

6. Continue proof/gallery/privacy automation.

---
# Build 171 sanity check

**Updated:** 2026-05-24

Build 171 sanity result: Admin Leads now has a quote-starter bridge, the lead/upload endpoints share the service-key alias pattern from the auth fallback work, no new DDL is required, and release guards cover Cloudflare syntax, social workflow, competitor roadmap, Builds 160–171, and one-H1 validation.

Next sanity targets: test real staff login, real lead quote-starter generation, linked upload privacy warnings, and lead status transitions after deploy.

---
# Build 168 sanity check update

**Updated:** 2026-05-23

Build 168 sanity result: Cloudflare Pages Functions static check passed, Build 160-168 release guards passed, inline Admin Leads script syntax checked, and SEO/H1 validation passed with no HTML page containing more than one H1.

Manual smoke tests after deployment:

1. Apply Build 167 SQL and Build 168 SQL in Supabase.
2. Visit `/admin-leads.html` as an admin or booking manager.
3. Confirm leads list loads or shows a migration hint.
4. Submit a test fleet/maintenance lead and save a status/note from Admin Leads.
5. If direct uploads are enabled, upload one test image/video and mark privacy status before using it publicly.

---

# Build 167 update

Build 167 sanity check: competitor matrix public foundations now include direct upload foundation, structured lead forms, schema foundations, and one-H1/Cloudflare/release guards.

---

# Build 166 sanity check update

**Updated:** 2026-05-23

Build 166 attempts to complete the public-facing items from `COMPETETIVE.md` by adding public routes for specials, gift cards, fleet, maintenance, and education, expanding the add-on catalog, adding sticky CTAs, updating Services/Homepage routing, and documenting status in `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md`. `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` remains the source of truth.


---

# Build 165 sync — Booking photo-estimate link capture

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 165 adds a public Booking Step 4 photo-estimate link field, sends the links through checkout, stores them in notes as a fallback, writes to optional `bookings.photo_estimate_links` when migrated, and shows clickable links in Admin Booking intake review. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 164 sync — Admin booking intake review actions

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 164 adds staff action controls to Admin Booking for photo-estimate status, condition-review status, media/privacy status, privacy checklist flags, blur/crop flags, and a staff intake-review note. The action writes directly to optional booking fields when the Build 162/163/164 migrations are applied and falls back to booking notes if the optional columns are not live yet. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 163 sync — booking intake admin review

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

Build 163 adds fallback-safe direct booking intake field storage and a staff-facing Admin Booking panel for estimate intake, condition-helper recommendations, media-consent preference, and privacy-review status hints. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 162 sync — condition helper and consent path

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

The public conversion path now has the next competitor-aligned layer: customers can use a condition helper instead of guessing package names. Checkout remains backwards-compatible by preserving condition helper details and media-consent preference in booking notes. A Build 162 SQL migration prepares optional direct DB fields for a later admin/reporting pass.

---

# Build 161 sync — SANITY_CHECK.md

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

The current website/app now has competitor-aligned service chooser coverage on Services and Booking, clearer public package aliases, and a Contact-page photo-estimate path. Build 161 is a no-DDL pass; the new package metadata is JSON/catalog content and should be copied into the DB-managed pricing catalog when the live catalog is refreshed.

---

# Build 160 sync — competitor sanity and roadmap reset

**Updated:** 2026-05-21  
**Current build:** Build 160

Build 160 reviewed `COMPETETIVE.md` against the current website/app and reset `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` as the top implementation source of truth. The project is strong on local pages, services/pricing/booking, gallery/recent work, admin workflows, social queue, and release checks. The next priority is public conversion clarity: service chooser guidance, package aliases, photo-estimate CTAs, FAQ/proof expansion, consent/media privacy gates, and DB-first admin content management.

Key Build 160 files: `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `COMPETITOR_SANITY_CHECK.md`, `COMPETETIVE.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, `services.html`, `services/index.html`, `scripts/competitor_roadmap_check.py`, and `sql/2026-05-21_build160_competitor_sanity_roadmap_no_ddl_note.sql`.

# Build 158 update — Social review gates and local caption templates

**Updated:** 2026-05-20  
**Current build:** Build 158

Build 158 continues the Build 156/157 social publishing workflow and makes it safer before any job/crafting-progress photo or summary is pushed to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, or manual/webhook channels.

## Completed in Build 158

1. Added `functions/api/_lib/social-compliance.js`.
2. Added customer/public-use consent checks for social drafts.

16. Seeded local caption templates for Southern Ontario, Oxford County, Norfolk County, and Tillsonburg-style posts.
17. Seeded local hashtag presets for Rosie Dazzlers local discovery.
18. Added `duplicate_signature` on queued posts to support future duplicate-content warnings.
19. Updated social workflow release checks for Build 158 markers.
20. Updated Markdown and schema notes for the new social review gate.

## Next 20 value-added steps after Build 158

1. Apply the Build 156 social queue migration if it has not already been run.
2. Apply `sql/2026-05-20_build158_social_review_gates_and_templates.sql`.
3. Test Admin Progress with one internal job update and one media URL.
4. Confirm a draft is created with platform warnings in Admin Social Queue.
5. Confirm `Publish/API` is blocked until `Approve & ready` is clicked.
6. Add a duplicate-content warning in the Admin Social Queue UI using `duplicate_signature`.
7. Add a template picker that loads `social_caption_templates` from the DB.

# Sanity Check — Build 157


**Build 157 update — 2026-05-19:** Social progress publishing bridge added. Admin Progress can automatically create social drafts and optionally attempt approved API/webhook posting. Admin Social Queue now supports Publish/API, Send webhook, Copy text/media, Ready, Mark posted, and Skip. No DDL is required beyond Build 156; Build 157 adds `sql/2026-05-19_build157_social_api_publish_bridge_no_ddl_note.sql`.


**Updated:** 2026-05-18

## Release checks to run

```bash
python scripts/release_check.py
```

Build 155 release check coverage includes:

- JSON parsing under `data/`
- `sitemap.xml` parsing
- Cloudflare Pages Functions deploy-safety checks
- static page/link checks
- local SEO/H1 audit
- catalog fallback merge checks
- service-area rule checks
- catalog quality report
- catalog DB import preview
- service/product link checks
- Amazon catalog match checks
- mobile navigation checks
- landing-photo checks
- Admin App editor checks
- inventory image picker/fallback checks
- media-library picker / repair / duplicate / health-scan checks

## Manual smoke tests after deploy

1. Open Admin Catalog while signed in as staff/admin.
2. Confirm inventory loads even if `/api/admin/catalog_inventory_list` falls back or returns partial DB rows.
3. Edit a saved DB item that previously had a blank image and confirm the fallback-matched image appears.
4. Open **Pick existing image** and confirm bundled images plus media-library rows appear when available.
5. Select a fallback-matched row and click **Repair selected images**.
6. Reload and confirm the image remains saved on the row.
7. Click **Scan visible images** and confirm failed images are reported without breaking the page.
8. Confirm duplicate-image warnings are informational and do not block editing.
9. Check Home, Services, Pricing, Book, Gear, Consumables, Gallery, and Contact for one H1 and normal CSS layout.
10. Confirm clean routes do not create redirect loops.

## Known deploy caution

`app_media_library` may not be populated on dev yet. That is okay. Admin Catalog should still work through app settings and bundled JSON/R2 fallbacks. Build 155 also specifically guards the prior Cloudflare deploy failure in `media_library_list.js` and duplicate landing-page object-key warnings.

<!-- Build 155 sync 2026-05-18 -->

## Build 155 sanity check

- PASS: `scripts/cloudflare_pages_functions_check.py` completed successfully across 499 JavaScript files.
- PASS: Node syntax checks completed successfully across 384 Functions JavaScript files.
- PASS: relative import resolution check found no unresolved local JavaScript imports.
- PASS: no esbuild-sensitive literal newline regex issue found in media-library route files.
- PASS: landing page normalizePage duplicate-key check is clean.

## Build 155 Cloudflare stale root function shim hotfix - 2026-05-19

Cloudflare still saw older flat `/functions/api/*.js` route files after GitHub web uploads, because uploading ZIP contents does not reliably delete older files from the branch. Build 155 intentionally includes compatibility shim files for the stale flat routes listed in the Cloudflare deploy log. Each shim re-exports the active `/functions/api/admin/*.js` implementation and prevents Pages Functions bundling failures while preserving the newer admin route implementation.

Next step: after Build 155 deploys cleanly, optionally remove the compatibility shims in a clean-branch/orphan rebuild so only the intended folder-backed route files remain.


## Build 155 Cloudflare root import release-check hotfix - 2026-05-18

Build 155 repairs the remaining root Cloudflare Pages Function import paths that could still break deployment after Build 154. Four root `/functions/api/*.js` files still used `../_lib/...`; root routes must use `./_lib/...`. Build 155 fixes those files, keeps the stale-route shims, wires the stale-root import guard into the release checklist, and updates the release runner so the full check can complete in this sandbox.

Build 155 release check passed with JSON, sitemap, Cloudflare Functions, stale-root import, static, SEO/H1, catalog fallback, service-area, catalog quality, import preview, Amazon match, mobile nav, landing-photo, Admin App editor, inventory picker, and media-library picker checks.

## Build 156 sync note - social progress publishing

Build 156 adds a reviewable social publishing foundation. Admin Progress can now create internal social drafts from job updates/media, Admin Social Queue can review and mark those drafts, and the schema now includes `social_channels`, `social_post_queue`, and `social_dispatch_attempts`. Direct posting to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, and other platforms is possible later after the required platform credentials, app approvals, and consent/compliance checks are in place.


## Next 20 value-added steps after Build 156

1. Run the Build 156 social queue SQL migration in Supabase.
2. Add a Social Queue card to staff role training notes so detailers know drafts are not public posts yet.
3. Decide the first direct-post platform: recommended order is Facebook/Instagram, Google Business Profile, X, TikTok, then YouTube Shorts.
4. Add per-platform caption length warnings and media-count warnings.
5. Add a privacy checklist before any customer vehicle/photo can be marked ready.
6. Add license-plate blur/cover reminder fields to the media workflow.
7. Add customer consent flags for public before/after use.
8. Add a reusable caption template library for job type, vehicle size, service area, and upsell language.
9. Add platform-specific hashtag presets for local SEO and discovery.
10. Add OAuth setup notes and token rotation guidance for each social platform.
11. Add a direct Meta/Facebook Page adapter after the app permissions are approved.
12. Add an Instagram Business publishing adapter after Meta media-container requirements are confirmed.
13. Add a Google Business Profile recent-work publishing path after the Google account scope is finalized.
14. Add a TikTok direct-post adapter only after app review and creator authorization are confirmed.
15. Add a queue calendar so posts can be scheduled by day/time.
16. Add duplicate-content warnings when the same photo/caption is queued twice.
17. Add analytics fields for clicked progress links and posted platform URLs.
18. Add customer-friendly public gallery promotion rules from approved job media.
19. Add fallback export buttons: copy caption, download media list, and open platform composer.
20. Add social performance notes back into the booking/customer history for future marketing decisions.

## Build 159 sync — social queue usability and release discipline

- Added caption/hashtag DB picker support for Admin Social Queue.
- Added planned publish time for manual drafts and schedule filtering.
- Added duplicate draft warnings using `duplicate_signature`.
- Added manual posted URL and platform post ID capture.
- Added `social_post_metrics_snapshots` schema support for future reporting.
- Release checks now require the Build 159 social template/schedule markers.

## Build 169 sanity check

- Verify `/login` loads with no raw 500s from `api/admin/auth_me`, `api/client/auth_me`, or `api/analytics/ingest`.
- Verify `/favicon.ico` returns a file.
- Attempt staff login. If it fails, read the JSON error and check Cloudflare Supabase variables, auth/session tables, and password hash mode.
- Re-test `/admin-leads.html` after staff login succeeds.
Build 169 adds `scripts/auth_analytics_build169_check.py` and wires it into `scripts/release_check.py`.

## Build 170 sanity check

- Confirmed the remaining reported console error was `/api/client/dashboard` returning 401 for signed-out optional context.
- Updated customer dashboard endpoint to return signed-out/degraded JSON with HTTP 200.
- Added a Build 170 release guard and a no-DDL SQL note.
- Next live test: `/login`, `/book`, and `/my-account` with DevTools open.

---
> Build 174 documentation sync (2026-05-24): persistent quote/proposal drafts were added to Admin Leads with save/load APIs, SQL table foundation, schema notes, and release guard coverage. Quote starters remain copy-ready before the SQL is applied, but saved drafts require sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql.


## Build 175 sanity check — conversion_content_gallery_analytics

Build 175 adds a broad but safe foundation pass: quote/pricing/conversion tools in Admin Leads, expanded content-block editing in Admin Content, privacy-enforced gallery filtering by service/town, and admin conversion analytics. The release guard is `scripts/build175_conversion_content_gallery_analytics_check.py` and it is included in `scripts/release_check.py`.

## Build 176 Update — conversion-to-booking, dashboard cards, and privacy warnings

- Added a reviewed conversion draft → real booking workflow so Admin Leads can create a live booking only after staff confirms service date, AM/PM slot, address, package, vehicle size, customer name, and customer email.
- Added Admin Analytics cards for FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion summary using `/api/admin/conversion_funnel_summary`.
- Added App Management media privacy readiness warnings using `/api/admin/media_privacy_review_summary` so gallery/social reuse is checked before publishing.
- Preserved the one-H1 exposed-page rule and kept local SEO wording/access paths focused on Oxford/Norfolk service discovery.
- Added Build 176 SQL/schema notes for `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_booking_id` and `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_at`.

### Build 176 sanity check

- Admin Leads now supports lead → quote starter → quote draft → conversion draft → real booking.
- Admin Analytics now surfaces FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion summary.
- Admin App now includes a media privacy readiness check before public gallery/social reuse.
- Exposed pages still pass the one-H1 rule.
> Build 177 documentation sync (2026-05-25): added protected conversion-draft review queue, catalog-backed final price reconciliation, local SEO proof coverage reporting, public gallery privacy badges, SQL/schema notes, and release guard coverage.


> Build 178 documentation sync (2026-05-25): added conversion status saving, saved final price reviews, public content block rendering, media privacy badges, proof recommendations, schema note, and release guard coverage.

---

## Build 179 documentation sync — publish blocking, proof tasks, quote acceptance

Build 179 adds hard social publish blocking before webhook/API/manual posted actions, assignable local SEO proof tasks from proof recommendations, and customer-facing quote/proposal delivery plus accept/decline tracking. Schema tracking now points to `sql/2026-05-26_build179_publish_block_tasks_quote_acceptance.sql`. The one-H1 SEO rule, local service/town wording, and fallback-safe API pattern remain required on every pass.

### Build 179 sanity check

Verify Social Queue publish/webhook/manual posted actions refuse unapproved media drafts, Admin Analytics can create local proof tasks, Admin Leads can prepare quote delivery links, and `/quote-response.html` records accepted/declined responses after Build 179 SQL is applied.

### Build 180 update — accepted quote deposit/payment request and final booking confirmation

Build 180 connects the accepted quote workflow to a safer payment-request foundation. Staff can create a tracked deposit/payment request from an accepted quote/proposal draft, share the private `/quote-payment.html` customer page, mark deposits paid from Admin Leads, and link or confirm the final booking when a booking row is available. Schema tracking was updated for `public.quote_deposit_payment_requests` and the quote/conversion deposit status fields.

## Build 180 sanity check

The customer quote chain now has these stages:

1. Staff prepares quote/proposal draft.
2. Customer accepts or declines through `/quote-response.html`.
3. Staff creates a deposit/payment request from the accepted draft.
4. Customer reviews the private `/quote-payment.html` request.
5. Staff records/links paid deposit and confirms the final booking when a booking exists.

Still outstanding: automate provider-confirmed paid status through payment webhooks.

> Build 181 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added verified Stripe/PayPal webhook settlement for `quote_deposit_payment_requests`, PayPal quote-deposit order/capture support, automatic deposit-paid updates, booking confirmation linking, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard and local service/town wording rules remain required on every pass.

> Build 182 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added quote-deposit webhook event history, verified-event replay controls, customer receipt email queueing, manual/provider refund and partial-refund tracking, `/admin-payments.html`, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, and Markdown/schema synchronization remain required on every pass.

## Build 182 sanity check

Payment flow now covers accepted quote → deposit request → provider verified paid status → receipt email queue → booking confirmation link when a booking exists. It also covers webhook history, verified replay, and refund/partial-refund tracking. Remaining payment work is direct provider refund initiation, payment reconciliation export, and delivery-status dashboards for queued receipt/refund emails.

## Build 183 documentation sync — direct refunds, reconciliation export, webhook warnings, and image requirements

Build 183 adds direct Stripe/PayPal refund initiation from Admin Payments, a payment reconciliation CSV export, dashboard/payment-page warnings for failed or unverified webhook events, and a cleared/rebuilt `IMAGES.md` with missing image/video requirements and upload methods. This build is no-DDL and depends on the Build 180–182 payment tables. SEO/H1, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, schema tracking, and Markdown synchronization remain required on every pass.

## Build 183 sanity check

Payment operations now cover accepted quote deposit requests, provider webhooks, receipt/refund email queueing, provider refund initiation, refund records, replay controls, warning summaries, and CSV reconciliation export. Media readiness is clearer because `IMAGES.md` now lists missing add-on fallback images, package images to verify, regional placeholders to replace, gallery proof pairs needed, and first proof videos to capture/upload.
