# Build 184 update — 20-step operations, media, and payment hardening

**Updated:** 2026-06-01  
**Build:** 184

Build 184 completes the requested next-20 pass by tightening the payment/refund operations, improving image/media readiness review, and documenting the next operational bundle. This pass is intentionally no-DDL: it uses the existing Build 180–182 payment tables and the Build 183 image requirements foundation.

## Build 184 — 20 completed items

1. Added `/admin-media-health.html` and `/admin-media-health/` so staff can review missing required photos/videos from a protected admin page.
2. Added `/api/admin/media_asset_health_scan` to scan required public R2/media URLs and return missing/not-public files with upload keys.
3. Added `data/image_requirements_build184.json` as the machine-readable source for required app, add-on, landing, gallery, and proof images.
4. Added the Media Health page to the shared Admin Menu.
5. Added Media Health access rules to `assets/admin-auth.js`.
6. Added a Media Health card to the Admin Dashboard.
7. Added `/api/admin/payment_refund_status_poll` so staff can poll Stripe/PayPal refund status and refresh local refund rows.
8. Added `/api/admin/payment_receipt_resend` so staff can requeue a customer quote-deposit receipt email from a payment request.
9. Added `/api/admin/payment_accountant_package_export` for an accountant-style payment CSV with Ontario HST allocation estimates.
10. Added an **Export accountant package** button to Admin Payments.
11. Added **Resend receipt** controls to quote deposit/payment request cards.
12. Added **Poll provider status** controls to refund record cards.
13. Kept manual refund records, provider refund initiation, webhook settlement, and replay controls on one Payments page for easier review.
14. Added `sql/2026-06-01_build184_twenty_step_ops_media_payment_no_ddl_note.sql` to document the no-DDL Build 184 schema status.
15. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` with Build 184 operational notes.
16. Updated `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md` with the Build 184 no-DDL dependency summary.
17. Updated `IMAGES.md` with the Admin Media Health scan workflow and upload review method.
18. Updated `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md` to reflect Build 184 media/payment/accounting hardening.
19. Added `scripts/build184_twenty_step_ops_media_payment_check.py` and wired it into the release check chain.
20. Re-ran the one-H1 and release guard path so exposed public pages still use one clear H1.

## Next 20 steps after Build 184

1. Deploy Build 184 and test `/admin-media-health.html` against live R2 assets.
2. Upload the missing add-on images listed in `IMAGES.md`, then re-run the Media Health scan.
3. Replace regional landing placeholders with Rosie-owned images for Tillsonburg, Woodstock/Ingersoll, Simcoe/Delhi, Port Dover, Norwich/Otterville, and Waterford/Vittoria.
4. Capture the first four approved-public before/after gallery proof sets by town/service.
5. Add real image dimension validation instead of URL-only health checks.
6. Add R2 signed upload URLs for admin media replacement so uploads can happen from the app instead of the Cloudflare dashboard only.
7. Add a media task status table so missing-image items can be assigned, marked uploaded, reviewed, and approved.
8. Add provider refund polling for payment requests without refund rows, not only existing refund records.
9. Add scheduled retry checks for pending Stripe/PayPal refunds.
10. Add payment reconciliation variance warnings for paid amount vs. quote/deposit amount.
11. Add processor fee capture and estimated net payout fields to the payment export.
12. Add HST/GST allocation review screens before accountant export is considered final.
13. Add failed receipt email retry controls and visible notification-event status on Admin Payments.
14. Add customer-facing receipt PDF/download links.
15. Add final-balance invoice/payment requests after job completion.
16. Add payment application to final invoices, deposits, refunds, and tips.
17. Add month-end payment close checklist tied to reconciled provider exports.
18. Add dashboard warnings for missing images on high-traffic public pages.
19. Add Search Console/local SEO task cards tied to missing service/town proof content.
20. Add a consolidated accountant export package that bundles payment CSV, refund CSV, journal candidates, HST summary, and close checklist.

# Build 171 documentation sync note

**Updated:** 2026-05-24

This Markdown file was reviewed during the Build 171 pass. Current source of truth remains `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`. Build 171 adds the Admin Leads quote-starter workflow and no new DDL.

# Build 164 sync — booking intake review fields

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 164 adds optional booking review fields through `sql/2026-05-22_build164_booking_intake_review_actions.sql`: `intake_review_note`, `intake_reviewed_at`, and `intake_reviewed_by`. These support the Admin Booking photo-estimate, condition-review, and media/privacy review action controls. The workflow remains fallback-safe before migration by appending staff review status to booking notes.

---

# Repo Rules — Build 155

**Updated:** 2026-05-18

1. Keep public pages to one clear H1.
2. Keep local SEO wording in titles, meta descriptions, headings, and visible copy.
3. Do not remove JSON fallbacks until the matching DB editor/import/rollback flow is stable.
4. Keep root and folder-backed route copies synchronized.
5. Update Markdown and schema files on every build pass.
6. Prefer robust fallbacks and visible staff-facing errors over silent failures.
7. Run `python scripts/release_check.py` before packaging a ZIP; this now includes Cloudflare Pages Functions deploy-safety checks.
8. For inventory media, prefer `app_media_library` plus R2 URLs, but keep bundled image fallback working.

<!-- Build 155 sync 2026-05-18 -->

## Build 155 repo rule update

Cloudflare Pages Functions route files must use relative helper imports that resolve from their actual folder. Root `/functions/api/*.js` files must use `./_lib/...`; nested route files may use the correct relative path for their folder. The deploy-safety script now checks this before packaging.


## Build 155 Cloudflare root import release-check hotfix - 2026-05-18

Build 155 repairs the remaining root Cloudflare Pages Function import paths that could still break deployment after Build 154. Four root `/functions/api/*.js` files still used `../_lib/...`; root routes must use `./_lib/...`. Build 155 fixes those files, keeps the stale-route shims, wires the stale-root import guard into the release checklist, and updates the release runner so the full check can complete in this sandbox.

## Build 156 sync note - social progress publishing

Build 156 adds a reviewable social publishing foundation. Admin Progress can now create internal social drafts from job updates/media, Admin Social Queue can review and mark those drafts, and the schema now includes `social_channels`, `social_post_queue`, and `social_dispatch_attempts`. Direct posting to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, and other platforms is possible later after the required platform credentials, app approvals, and consent/compliance checks are in place.

---

## Build 161 sync note

Build 161 keeps `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` as the source of truth and advances the competitor-aligned conversion path with Booking service chooser guidance, package aliases, and photo-estimate CTAs.

---
> Build 174 documentation sync (2026-05-24): persistent quote/proposal drafts were added to Admin Leads with save/load APIs, SQL table foundation, schema notes, and release guard coverage. Quote starters remain copy-ready before the SQL is applied, but saved drafts require sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql.


## Build 175 update — lead conversion, pricing suggestions, content expansion, gallery privacy, and analytics

- Added safe lead → draft booking/quote conversion using `public.lead_conversion_drafts` instead of creating live scheduled bookings too early.
- Added catalog-backed package/add-on price suggestions for Admin Leads from the current pricing catalog.
- Added quote draft status workflow controls: draft, needs review, ready to send, sent, accepted, declined, archived.
- Expanded Admin Content Center beyond FAQ with reusable content blocks for specials, service blurbs, homepage cards, help articles, trust proof, fleet, and maintenance copy.
- Added service/town filtering for the public before/after gallery and enforced public reuse only for approved-public/sample media.
- Added FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion analytics summary endpoint for admin reporting.
- Added SQL/schema sync in `sql/2026-05-25_build175_lead_conversion_content_gallery_analytics.sql`.

## Build 176 Update — conversion-to-booking, dashboard cards, and privacy warnings

- Added a reviewed conversion draft → real booking workflow so Admin Leads can create a live booking only after staff confirms service date, AM/PM slot, address, package, vehicle size, customer name, and customer email.
- Added Admin Analytics cards for FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion summary using `/api/admin/conversion_funnel_summary`.
- Added App Management media privacy readiness warnings using `/api/admin/media_privacy_review_summary` so gallery/social reuse is checked before publishing.
- Preserved the one-H1 exposed-page rule and kept local SEO wording/access paths focused on Oxford/Norfolk service discovery.
- Added Build 176 SQL/schema notes for `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_booking_id` and `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_at`.
> Build 177 documentation sync (2026-05-25): added protected conversion-draft review queue, catalog-backed final price reconciliation, local SEO proof coverage reporting, public gallery privacy badges, SQL/schema notes, and release guard coverage.


> Build 178 documentation sync (2026-05-25): conversion status saves, saved final price reviews, public content rendering, privacy badges, and proof recommendation work were reflected in the active docs/schema notes.

## Build 179 documentation sync — publish blocking, proof tasks, quote acceptance

Build 179 adds hard social publish blocking before webhook/API/manual posted actions, assignable local SEO proof tasks from proof recommendations, and customer-facing quote/proposal delivery plus accept/decline tracking. Schema tracking now points to `sql/2026-05-26_build179_publish_block_tasks_quote_acceptance.sql`. The one-H1 SEO rule, local service/town wording, and fallback-safe API pattern remain required on every pass.

---

### Build 180 update — accepted quote deposit/payment request and final booking confirmation

Build 180 connects the accepted quote workflow to a safer payment-request foundation. Staff can create a tracked deposit/payment request from an accepted quote/proposal draft, share the private `/quote-payment.html` customer page, mark deposits paid from Admin Leads, and link or confirm the final booking when a booking row is available. Schema tracking was updated for `public.quote_deposit_payment_requests` and the quote/conversion deposit status fields.
---

> Build 181 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added verified Stripe/PayPal webhook settlement for `quote_deposit_payment_requests`, PayPal quote-deposit order/capture support, automatic deposit-paid updates, booking confirmation linking, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard and local service/town wording rules remain required on every pass.

> Build 182 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added quote-deposit webhook event history, verified-event replay controls, customer receipt email queueing, manual/provider refund and partial-refund tracking, `/admin-payments.html`, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, and Markdown/schema synchronization remain required on every pass.

---

## Build 183 documentation sync — direct refunds, reconciliation export, webhook warnings, and image requirements

Build 183 adds direct Stripe/PayPal refund initiation from Admin Payments, a payment reconciliation CSV export, dashboard/payment-page warnings for failed or unverified webhook events, and a cleared/rebuilt `IMAGES.md` with missing image/video requirements and upload methods. This build is no-DDL and depends on the Build 180–182 payment tables. SEO/H1, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, schema tracking, and Markdown synchronization remain required on every pass.
