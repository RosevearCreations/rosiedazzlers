# Rosie Dazzlers Access Control Model

## Purpose
This document defines the first structured access model for the Rosie Dazzlers app so future development can safely support:
- Admin users
- Senior Detailers
- Detailers
- Customers
- Customer tiers (random, regular, silver, gold, vip)

This file is the human-readable rulebook that sits beside the database schema.

---

---

### C) Detailer
Operational field user.

Typical abilities:
- View assigned bookings
- Fill out pre-job intake
- Post progress updates
- Attach media
- Start / stop / break time tracking
- Record on-site notes
- Record owner acknowledgement details

Restrictions:
- Cannot override senior detailer or admin changes
- Cannot manage promos
- Cannot manage staff users
- Cannot change blocked dates / slot availability by default
- Cannot edit bookings outside their allowed scope
- Cannot see sensitive admin-only financial controls unless explicitly allowed

Examples:
- Field detailer
- Assistant detailer
- Junior team member

---

### D) Customer
Public-facing user connected to a booking or customer profile.

Typical abilities:
- View booking-specific progress page through token link
- View customer-visible progress notes
- View customer-visible media
- Submit signoff
- View status of their own booking
- Potentially log in later if account system is added

Restrictions:
- Cannot see internal notes
- Cannot see internal-only media
- Cannot see staff notes
- Cannot edit booking pricing or operational controls
- Cannot access admin pages

---

## 2) Staff role codes

Current planned role codes:
- `admin`
- `senior_detailer`
- `detailer`

These are stored in:
- `public.staff_users.role_code`

Permission booleans in `staff_users` control extra privileges:
- `can_override_lower_entries`
- `can_manage_bookings`
- `can_manage_blocks`
- `can_manage_progress`
- `can_manage_promos`
- `can_manage_staff`

This means role + permission flags can work together.

Example:
A senior detailer may normally not manage promos, but could be granted it later without redesigning the entire role system.

---

## 3) Customer tiers

Customer tiers are business/value segments, not security roles.

Current planned tier codes:
- `random`
- `regular`
- `silver`
- `gold`
- `vip`

These tiers are stored in:
- `public.customer_tiers`
- `public.customer_profiles.tier_code`
- optionally copied onto bookings as `customer_tier_code`

### Customer tier meaning
- **random**: one-off / unknown / first-time customer
- **regular**: returning customer
- **silver**: good repeat customer
- **gold**: high-value or priority customer
- **vip**: top-tier preferred customer

### Intended future uses
Customer tiers may affect:
- priority booking windows
- preferred scheduling
- loyalty offers
- manual promo logic
- customer service priority
- reminder / follow-up handling

Important:
Customer tier is **not** the same as access permission.
A VIP customer still remains a customer in the access system.

---

## 4) Override rules

### Detailer
- Can create intake and progress entries
- Can edit their own entries if editing is allowed
- Cannot override senior detailer or admin entries

### Senior Detailer
- Can override detailer-entered intake/progress/media
- Override action should be logged in `staff_override_log`

### Admin
- Can override any lower-level operational entry
- Override action should be logged in `staff_override_log`

### Override logging
Whenever a higher-trust staff member changes another staff member’s protected entry, log:
- booking id
- source table
- source row id
- previous staff user
- overriding staff user
- reason
- summary of change

---

## 5) Visibility levels

Current main visibility values:
- `customer`
- `internal`

Used in:
- `job_updates.visibility`
- `job_media.visibility`

### Customer visibility
Visible to:
- customer progress page
- admin
- appropriate staff

### Internal visibility
Visible to:
- admin
- permitted staff only

Never visible to customer progress page.

---

## 6) Booking access model

### Admin
Can access all bookings.

### Senior Detailer
Should be able to access:
- assigned bookings
- optionally unassigned bookings if granted
- bookings they are supervising

### Detailer
Should be able to access:
- assigned bookings only
- maybe temporarily shared bookings if explicitly assigned

### Customer
Can access:
- only the booking tied to their progress token or future account link

---

## 7) Job-site intake ownership

The `jobsite_intake` record belongs to:
- one booking
- usually one active detailer or senior detailer session
- but may later be updated by a higher role

Important fields:
- `detailer_name`
- `last_updated_by_staff_user_id`

Future rule:
- track who last edited intake
- prevent silent overwrites by lower-trust users

---

## 8) Time tracking access

Planned rules:
- Detailer can record arrival/start/stop/break
- Senior Detailer can correct or override detailer time logs
- Admin can correct all time logs
- All overrides should be auditable

Time data should eventually support:
- arrival time
- work start time
- work stop time
- break start / stop
- weather breaks
- unscheduled breaks
- total paid work time
- total paused time

---

## 9) Live progress model

As a job runs:
- Detailer posts progress notes
- Detailer attaches photos/media
- Customer sees customer-visible items
- Admin sees everything
- Senior Detailer sees assigned and permitted jobs
- Internal notes never appear on customer page

This should support:
- real-time admin visibility
- customer visibility
- field updates without exposing internal details publicly

---

## 10) Future authentication path

Current state:
- admin pages use shared admin password in page/API flow
- customer progress uses token link

Future recommended direction:
- staff login system
- role-based session management
- customer login / profile access
- per-user audit trail
- per-action authorization checks
- token + session hybrid for customer progress

### Recommended implementation order
1. keep shared admin password working
2. add staff user records
3. add staff login/session layer
4. enforce role-based page/API access
5. add customer profile/account layer later

---

## 11) Practical development rules

When building future pages/endpoints:

### Rule 1
Never assume all staff are admins.

### Rule 2
Never expose internal notes or internal media to customer pages.

### Rule 3
Customer tier is business segmentation, not staff privilege.

### Rule 4
Any override by a higher role should be auditable.

### Rule 5
Assigned detailers should only see the bookings they are supposed to work on unless explicitly granted wider access.

### Rule 6
Do not remove the current token-based customer progress system while building staff authentication.

### Rule 7
Prefer additive changes over destructive rewrites.

---

## 12) Immediate next implementation targets

After this document, the best next build steps are:

1. create `admin-staff.html`
2. create `/functions/api/admin/staff_list.js`
3. create `/functions/api/admin/staff_save.js`
4. update job-site intake save/load to include `staff_user_id`
5. add role-aware restriction checks to admin/jobsite/progress endpoints
6. build time-tracking tables and endpoints
7. build live job-site dashboard view for admin

---

## 13) Summary

This system has three main layers:

### Staff permissions
Who can do operational work and who can override it

### Customer visibility
What the customer can see during booking progress

### Customer business tier
How valuable / recurring the customer is from a service and loyalty perspective

These must remain separate concepts so the system stays clean and flexible.

## 2026-04-13 Pass 14 Sync
- Booking screen remains stable and should not be altered in future passes unless a critical bug appears.
- `_redirects` is working and treated as complete for the current route layout.
- Pricing/packages/add-ons/service areas/travel charges continue to flow through the App Management pricing control center as the preferred single entry point.
- This pass added office-facing finance adjustments for discounts/refunds plus customer-facing document work for order confirmation, invoice / summary, gift certificate printing, and social feed management.

> Pass sync April 15, 2026: generated local price-chart PNG assets from the canonical bundled pricing catalog, rewired chart fallbacks to `/assets/brand`, added a regeneration script, and refreshed docs/schema notes for the legacy price-image carry-forward pass.
- Pass sync 2026-04-16 (pass 21): added crew time/payroll workflow, staff availability blocks, payroll runs + accounting-post option, staff pay/work-cap settings, and service-time insight reporting; booking screen remains stable.

- Pass 22 sync: fixed admin-accounting date/input layout, moved admin-staff to a left-side internal menu layout, normalized admin login redirects to .html, and added clean admin route rewrites for payroll/staff/accounting/app/login.

---

## Pass 24 Sync — 2026-04-17

This pass focused on three areas:
- normalized the shared top admin navigation and repaired the off-pattern `admin-assign` header so the top menu matches the other admin screens more closely
- shifted the public self-serve direction back to a booking-led planner on the pricing page by embedding the live booking experience so customers keep the exact service-area restrictions, 21-day availability windows, slot logic, and booking aesthetics instead of using a separate quote-builder path
- continued the scheduled e-gift direction by exposing public growth settings, improving the gift message/send-date experience, and adding live recipient/delivery preview boxes on the gifts page

Schema impact for this pass: no new tables or columns. Existing `app_management_settings` is reused for public quote, e-gift, and membership display settings.

Pass sync: April 17, 2026 — pricing now restores the booking page as the first self-serve step by embedding the live booking planner on /pricing so service-area restrictions, 21-day availability windows, add-on logic, and booking aesthetics stay in one source of truth.
- 2026-04-17 pass26: extended booking-led self-serve with live embedded planner summaries on pricing and service-gift redemption preview, plus richer gift delivery metadata (sender name, preferred send date, message) through checkout, webhook, receipt, and printable certificate.
