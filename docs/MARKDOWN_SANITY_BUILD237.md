# Build 237 Markdown Sanity and Retirement Plan

**Updated:** 2026-07-28

## Two living direction documents

1. `AI_PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` — current architecture, deployment, migrations, safeguards and immediate operating context.
2. `MASTER_VALUE_ROADMAP.md` — current business direction, prioritized roadmap and next-cycle choices.

## Canonical operating documents

- `STARTUP_GO_LIVE_BLOCKERS.md` — ordered go-live blockers and exact instructions.
- `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md` — current unresolved technical/operational risk register.
- `SANITY_CHECK.md` — current build sanity result.
- `IMAGES.md` — visual replacement requirements.
- `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` and `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md` — canonical schema/reference.

## Retained historical documents

All other Markdown remains retained for audit, release-guard and historical context. Build 237 adds a synchronization footer to every Markdown file so a new AI/chat knows that historical files are not competing roadmaps. Do not delete them until release checks are changed from brittle historical text markers to current feature/route/API tests.

## Retirement sequence

1. Inventory every Markdown dependency in `scripts/*.py`.
2. Replace historical content-marker checks with current functional checks.
3. Move superseded documents to `docs/archive/` in small batches.
4. Update `DOC_INDEX.md`.
5. Run the complete release suite after each batch.
6. Delete only exact duplicates after hashes, references and release guards are verified.
