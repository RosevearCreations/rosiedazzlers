# Build 232 — Project controls, archive and draft history


## Build 232 — accessible project controls and archive history (2026-07-15)

Build 232 replaces the remaining JSON prompt used to edit project material, labour and cost rows with an accessible dialog form. It adds project budget and target-margin guidance, budget variance and break-even calculations, assignable/evidence-aware shot plans, reviewed consent-reminder queue records, draft revision history, and authenticated metadata-only archive downloads. Ordinary bookings remain unchanged; inventory posting still does not mutate stock; DAIP Gate C and all media/publication controls remain held.

Migration: `sql/2026-07-15_build232_project_controls_archive_history.sql`. Workspace: `/admin-creative-projects.html`.
