# Development Roadmap — Build 153

**Updated:** 2026-05-18  
**Target branch:** `dev`  
**Pass focus:** Cloudflare Pages Functions deploy hotfix, media-library endpoint syntax repair, duplicate landing-page key cleanup, release-check hardening, schema/docs synchronization, and continued SEO/H1/CSS release discipline.


## Build 153 completed deployment hotfix pass

1. Reviewed the Cloudflare Pages deploy log and confirmed the blocking error was an unterminated regular expression in `functions/api/admin/media_library_list.js`.
2. Repaired `normalizeList()` so comma/newline splitting uses an esbuild-safe `/[\n,]/` expression instead of a literal newline inside the regex character class.
3. Reviewed Cloudflare warnings in `functions/api/landing_pages_public.js`.
4. Removed duplicate `related_products` normalization from `normalizePage()` while keeping the richer image-capable product normalization.
5. Removed duplicate `hero_image_url`, `region_photo_caption`, `region_photo_source`, and `region_photo_source_url` keys from the same object literal.
6. Removed the now-unused `normalizeProductRefs()` helper to avoid future confusion between two product reference shapes.
7. Added `scripts/cloudflare_pages_functions_check.py` to catch deploy-only JavaScript issues before upload.
8. The new checker runs `node --check` across project JavaScript files and also catches literal-newline regex character classes that Cloudflare/esbuild can reject.
9. The new checker guards `landing_pages_public.js` against duplicate `normalizePage()` object keys.
10. Wired the new Cloudflare Pages Functions deploy-safety checker into `scripts/release_check.py`.
11. Re-ran the full release checklist after the deploy hotfix.
12. Updated Markdown and schema tracking notes so Build 153 is documented as the current baseline.

## Build 151 completed 20-step pass

1. Reviewed the Build 150 roadmap and known gaps before selecting the next inventory/media workflow items.
2. Added `/api/admin/media_library_list` as a staff-protected media-library read endpoint for Admin Catalog.
3. Made the new media-library endpoint DB-first against `app_media_library`.
4. Added fallback reading from `app_management_settings.media_library` if the DB media table is not available yet.
5. Kept the endpoint deploy-safe by returning warnings instead of breaking the page when optional media-library storage is missing.
6. Updated Admin Catalog image candidate collection so media rows can use `media_url`, `fallback_url`, `public_url`, or `url` in addition to existing inventory image fields.
7. Updated the existing image picker so it now searches media-library rows, bundled consumables/tools rows, saved DB rows, and saved helper URLs together.
8. Added media-library count visibility to the Admin Catalog image completeness summary.
9. Added **Repair selected images** to persist matched fallback images onto selected saved/fallback inventory rows.
10. Made selected image repair import selected bundled fallback rows when they are not yet saved to DB.
11. Protected existing deliberate DB images by skipping saved rows that already have a non-fallback image.
12. Added **Scan visible images** to browser-check up to 100 visible inventory image URLs.
13. Added per-row image health messages after a scan, showing whether an image passed or failed browser loading.
14. Added duplicate-image group detection to the inventory quality summary.
15. Added per-row duplicate-image warnings where multiple inventory rows use the same image URL.
16. Preserved the Build 150 fallback merge fix so blank DB `image_url` values still hydrate from matching bundled consumables/tools images.
17. Added `scripts/media_library_picker_check.py` to guard the new media picker, image repair, duplicate diagnostics, and image health markers.
18. Wired the new checker into `scripts/release_check.py` and expanded the inventory picker guard markers.
19. Added `sql/2026-05-18_build151_media_library_inventory_image_workflow.sql` and synchronized `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`.
20. Updated the active Markdown handoff, roadmap, gaps, schema, image, and sanity documents for Build 151.

## Next logical 20 steps

1. Apply the Build 150 and Build 151 SQL migrations in Supabase dev, then confirm `catalog_inventory_items` and `app_media_library` are present.
2. Smoke-test `/api/admin/media_library_list?usage_context=inventory_item` on the deployed dev URL while signed in as admin/staff.
3. Seed `app_media_library` from the current R2 product/tool image folders with `group_key='products'` and `usage_contexts` containing `inventory_item`.
4. Add an Admin Catalog **Upload image to R2** flow so new product/tool images do not require manual URL pasting.
5. Add editable image metadata in the picker: alt text, caption, source/consent, preferred public image, and recommended size.
6. Add a **Repair all fallback-matched images** review screen so staff can persist safe image fixes without selecting rows one by one.
7. Add a server-side image URL health report so 404/timeout checks can run without depending on browser scans.
8. Add a duplicate-image review screen where staff can mark duplicates as intentional multipack/shared-image cases.
9. Connect media rows to towns, services, reviews, and before/after gallery proof for stronger local landing pages.
10. Convert the before/after gallery from sample JSON into an admin-managed `app_content_entries` or dedicated DB content set.
11. Add receipt/bill attachment workflows to inventory purchases and accounting entries.
12. Link booking completion consumable usage to inventory movement and accounting COGS posting.
13. Add monthly inventory count sessions with variance approval and lock/reopen controls.
14. Connect vendor directory editing between Admin Catalog and Accounting so purchases, receipts, and reorders share one source.
15. Add Search Console and Google Business Profile reporting panels once credentials/API access are ready.
16. Continue town/service page improvements for Tillsonburg, Woodstock, Ingersoll, Simcoe, Delhi, Port Dover, and Norfolk/Oxford searches.
17. Replace remaining external/location placeholder photos with Rosie-owned R2-hosted local proof images.
18. Expand API fallback/error banners so staff can tell when the UI is using DB, app-setting, or bundled JSON fallbacks.
19. Add mobile detailer job closeout that records consumables/tools used, photos/videos, customer sign-off, and follow-up notes.
20. Keep every release pass checking one H1 per exposed page, local title/meta clarity, structured data, CSS drift, and stable redirects.

<!-- Build 153 sync 2026-05-18: Cloudflare Pages Functions deploy hotfix, media-library endpoint regex repair, landing-page duplicate-key cleanup, release-check hardening, schema sync, and local SEO/H1 discipline pass. -->

## Build 153 completed deployment repair pass

1. Repaired root `/functions/api/*.js` import paths from `../_lib/...` to `./_lib/...` so Cloudflare Pages Functions can resolve helpers.
2. Preserved valid nested admin imports and mirrored helper libraries as a defensive fallback for legacy flat route files.
3. Confirmed `functions/api/admin/media_library_list.js` no longer contains the esbuild-breaking regex newline issue.
4. Confirmed `functions/api/landing_pages_public.js` normalizePage no longer has duplicate object keys.
5. Added a no-DDL migration note for Build 153.
6. Hardened `scripts/cloudflare_pages_functions_check.py` to check relative import resolution before packaging.
7. Ran the Cloudflare deploy-safety check successfully across 499 JavaScript files.
8. Ran Node syntax checks successfully across 384 Functions JavaScript files.
9. Kept the Build 151 inventory media picker/fallback workflow unchanged.
10. Updated active Markdown and schema notes for Build 153.

## Next 20 recommended steps after Build 153

1. Deploy Build 153 to Cloudflare Pages and confirm the Functions compile finishes cleanly.
2. If any Cloudflare log remains, fix only the exact named file before starting new features.
3. Apply Build 150 and Build 151 SQL migrations in Supabase dev if not already applied.
4. Seed `app_media_library` from current R2 tool, consumable, add-on, and service-image folders.
5. Add an Admin Media Library screen to edit label, alt text, usage context, source status, and sort order.
6. Add direct R2 upload from Admin Catalog image picker.
7. Add bulk image repair for all inventory rows, not only visible selected rows.
8. Add a missing/duplicate/broken image dashboard for catalog, services, add-ons, and landing pages.
9. Add image alt-text quality scoring to Admin Catalog save validation.
10. Add local-service landing page smoke tests for title, meta, H1, locality terms, and canonical links.
11. Add deployed smoke checks for `/api/admin/media_library_list` and key Admin Catalog endpoints.
12. Move legacy flat root API JavaScript copies out of the live root once Cloudflare deploy is stable.
13. Keep `service-worker.js` as the only intentional root JavaScript file unless a page explicitly loads another root script.
14. Add a repo-cleanliness check that flags duplicate API route files outside `/functions`.
15. Add admin UI messaging when media library DB tables are unavailable and fallbacks are being used.
16. Add inventory/product image history so changed images can be reverted.
17. Add service-area/town page image assignment from the shared media library.
18. Continue one-H1 checks on every exposed page.
19. Continue CSS drift checks on public and admin pages after each feature pass.
20. Re-run the full release check after the deploy hotfix is confirmed.

## Build 154 Cloudflare stale root function shim hotfix - 2026-05-19

Cloudflare still saw older flat `/functions/api/*.js` route files after GitHub web uploads, because uploading ZIP contents does not reliably delete older files from the branch. Build 154 intentionally includes compatibility shim files for the stale flat routes listed in the Cloudflare deploy log. Each shim re-exports the active `/functions/api/admin/*.js` implementation and prevents Pages Functions bundling failures while preserving the newer admin route implementation.

Next step: after Build 154 deploys cleanly, optionally remove the compatibility shims in a clean-branch/orphan rebuild so only the intended folder-backed route files remain.
