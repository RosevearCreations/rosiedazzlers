# Build 174 update — Admin Leads quote/proposal drafts

**Updated:** 2026-05-24  
**Current build:** Build 174  
**Primary source of truth:** `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

Build 174 completes the next open competitive-matrix item after the quote starter: staff can now save generated quote starter text as a persistent quote/proposal draft from `/admin-leads.html`. This moves the workflow from copy-only follow-up toward a real quote pipeline while staying fallback-safe if the new table has not been applied yet.

## Completed in Build 174

1. Added `/api/admin/quote_proposal_drafts_save` for staff-protected quote/proposal draft creation and updates.
2. Added `/api/admin/quote_proposal_drafts_list` for staff-protected draft lookup by lead, booking, status, search, or id.
3. Updated `/admin-leads.html` and `/admin-leads/index.html` with **Save quote draft** and **Load drafts** actions on each public lead.
4. Added persistent draft display directly under the lead card so staff can see saved follow-up text before contacting a customer.
5. Added migration-safe fallback messages when the new draft table has not been applied yet.
6. Added SQL migration `sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql`.
7. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` and `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md` with the quote/proposal draft table plan.
8. Added release guard `scripts/quote_proposal_drafts_build174_check.py` and wired it into `scripts/release_check.py`.
9. Re-ran Cloudflare Functions checks, one-H1 validation, and release checks.

## Active next steps after Build 174

1. Apply `sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql` after the Build 167/168 lead SQL.
2. Browser-test `/admin-leads.html` by building a quote starter, saving it as a draft, and loading it again.
3. Add draft status controls for `needs_review`, `ready_to_send`, `sent`, `accepted`, and `declined`.
4. Add one-click lead → draft booking/quote conversion.
5. Add package/add-on price suggestions from the live pricing catalog.
6. Extend Admin Content Center to specials, service blurbs, homepage cards, and help articles.
7. Add service/town-aware proof filtering and media privacy enforcement before public gallery/social use.

# Build 173 handoff — next chat starting point

**Updated:** 2026-05-24

Start from Build 173. The next best work is to test `/admin-content.html`, apply the Build 172 FAQ SQL if not already applied, then extend Admin Content Center beyond FAQ to Specials, service blurbs, education/help articles, and homepage support cards. After that, return to persistent quote/proposal drafts and lead → booking conversion.

---
> Build 173 documentation sync (2026-05-24): Admin Content Center, FAQ editor APIs, expanded Help Articles access/content, public Help nav link, and schema no-DDL note were updated. See `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md`, and `SANITY_CHECK.md` for the active plan.

> Build 172 documentation sync (2026-05-24): Public FAQ page/content access, `/api/public_faqs`, `public_faq_entries` SQL foundation, sitemap/nav/footer links, and competitive-matrix status were updated. See `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, and `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md` for the active plan.

# Build 171 handoff for next chat

**Updated:** 2026-05-24

Use `/admin-leads.html` as the current operations hub for public leads and quote-photo uploads. Build 171 added `/api/admin/lead_quote_preview` and a **Build quote starter** UI action. The next pass should make the quote starter persistent: save quote drafts, add package/add-on price suggestions from the pricing catalog, and add one-click lead → draft booking conversion.

---
# Handoff for next chat — Build 168

**Updated:** 2026-05-23

Build 168 completed the Admin Leads and Photo Estimate Review foundation. Use `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` as the source of truth.

Important files changed:

- `admin-leads.html`
- `admin-leads/index.html`
- `assets/admin-auth.js`
- `assets/admin-menu.js`
- `admin.html`
- `admin/index.html`
- `functions/api/admin/public_inquiry_leads_list.js`
- `functions/api/admin/public_inquiry_leads_save.js`
- `functions/api/admin/photo_estimate_uploads_list.js`
- `functions/api/admin/photo_estimate_uploads_save.js`
- `sql/2026-05-23_build168_admin_leads_photo_review.sql`
- `scripts/admin_leads_build168_check.py`

Next best build: create the quote-builder/conversion action from a public lead or uploaded photo estimate.

---

# Build 167 update

Build 167 handoff: continue with Admin Leads, upload review, quote builder, DB-managed content, and service/town proof filtering. DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 166 handoff

**Updated:** 2026-05-23

Build 166 attempts to complete the public-facing items from `COMPETETIVE.md` by adding public routes for specials, gift cards, fleet, maintenance, and education, expanding the add-on catalog, adding sticky CTAs, updating Services/Homepage routing, and documenting status in `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md`. `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` remains the source of truth.


---

# Build 165 sync — Booking photo-estimate link capture

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 165 adds a public Booking Step 4 photo-estimate link field, sends the links through checkout, stores them in notes as a fallback, writes to optional `bookings.photo_estimate_links` when migrated, and shows clickable links in Admin Booking intake review. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 164 sync — Admin booking intake review actions

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 164 adds staff action controls to Admin Booking for photo-estimate status, condition-review status, media/privacy status, privacy checklist flags, blur/crop flags, and a staff intake-review note. The action writes directly to optional booking fields when the Build 162/163/164 migrations are applied and falls back to booking notes if the optional columns are not live yet. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 163 sync — booking intake admin review

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

Build 163 adds fallback-safe direct booking intake field storage and a staff-facing Admin Booking panel for estimate intake, condition-helper recommendations, media-consent preference, and privacy-review status hints. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Handoff — Build 162

Current build: Build 162. The public booking flow now includes a condition-based helper and media-consent preference. Treat `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` as the source of truth. Recommended next pass: apply/use the Build 162 DB columns, expose the fields in admin booking detail, then add real estimate photo upload and privacy review fields.

---

# Build 161 sync — HANDOFF_NEXT_CHAT.md

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

The current website/app now has competitor-aligned service chooser coverage on Services and Booking, clearer public package aliases, and a Contact-page photo-estimate path. Build 161 is a no-DDL pass; the new package metadata is JSON/catalog content and should be copied into the DB-managed pricing catalog when the live catalog is refreshed.

---

# Build 160 sync — competitor sanity and roadmap reset

**Updated:** 2026-05-21  
**Current build:** Build 160

Build 160 reviewed `COMPETETIVE.md` against the current website/app and reset `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` as the top implementation source of truth. The project is strong on local pages, services/pricing/booking, gallery/recent work, admin workflows, social queue, and release checks. The next priority is public conversion clarity: service chooser guidance, package aliases, photo-estimate CTAs, FAQ/proof expansion, consent/media privacy gates, and DB-first admin content management.

Key Build 160 files: `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `COMPETITOR_SANITY_CHECK.md`, `COMPETETIVE.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, `services.html`, `services/index.html`, `scripts/competitor_roadmap_check.py`, and `sql/2026-05-21_build160_competitor_sanity_roadmap_no_ddl_note.sql`.

# Build 158 update — Social review gates and local caption templates

**Updated:** 2026-05-20  
**Current build:** Build 158

Build 158 continues the Build 156/157 social publishing workflow and makes it safer before any job/crafting-progress photo or summary is pushed to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, or manual/webhook channels.

18. Added `duplicate_signature` on queued posts to support future duplicate-content warnings.
19. Updated social workflow release checks for Build 158 markers.
20. Updated Markdown and schema notes for the new social review gate.

# Handoff Next Chat — Build 158


**Build 157 update — 2026-05-19:** Social progress publishing bridge added. Admin Progress can automatically create social drafts and optionally attempt approved API/webhook posting. Admin Social Queue now supports Publish/API, Send webhook, Copy text/media, Ready, Mark posted, and Skip. No DDL is required beyond Build 156; Build 157 adds `sql/2026-05-19_build157_social_api_publish_bridge_no_ddl_note.sql`.


**Updated:** 2026-05-18

Current build: **Build 158**.

## What changed last

Build 155 repairs the Cloudflare Pages Functions deploy blocker in `/api/admin/media_library_list`, cleans duplicate landing-page public API object keys, and keeps the Build 151 media-library-aware image picker, selected-row fallback image repair, duplicate image diagnostics, and browser image health scanning.

## First things to test next

1. Apply Build 150 and Build 151 SQL migrations in Supabase dev.
2. Open Admin Catalog on the deployed dev URL.
3. Confirm existing fallback-matched images still appear.
4. Open **Pick existing image** and confirm images are searchable.
5. Select rows and test **Repair selected images**.
6. Run **Scan visible images** and review any failed URLs.

## Next coding direction

Deploy Build 155, confirm Cloudflare Pages Functions compile cleanly, then seed `app_media_library` from R2 product/tool folders and add direct R2 upload plus editable image metadata from Admin Catalog.

<!-- Build 155 sync 2026-05-18 -->

## Build 155 handoff note

Current build: **Build 158**. Deploy this ZIP next. It specifically repairs the Cloudflare Pages Functions unresolved `_lib` import errors that appeared after the regex fix. The next confirmation target is a clean Cloudflare Functions upload/compile.

## Build 155 Cloudflare stale root function shim hotfix - 2026-05-19

Cloudflare still saw older flat `/functions/api/*.js` route files after GitHub web uploads, because uploading ZIP contents does not reliably delete older files from the branch. Build 155 intentionally includes compatibility shim files for the stale flat routes listed in the Cloudflare deploy log. Each shim re-exports the active `/functions/api/admin/*.js` implementation and prevents Pages Functions bundling failures while preserving the newer admin route implementation.

Next step: after Build 155 deploys cleanly, optionally remove the compatibility shims in a clean-branch/orphan rebuild so only the intended folder-backed route files remain.


## Build 155 Cloudflare root import release-check hotfix - 2026-05-18

Build 155 repairs the remaining root Cloudflare Pages Function import paths that could still break deployment after Build 154. Four root `/functions/api/*.js` files still used `../_lib/...`; root routes must use `./_lib/...`. Build 155 fixes those files, keeps the stale-route shims, wires the stale-root import guard into the release checklist, and updates the release runner so the full check can complete in this sandbox.

Next chat should first review the latest Cloudflare deploy result. If deploy is clean, move into media-library seeding, direct R2 upload, and admin-managed before/after gallery content.

## Build 156 sync note - social progress publishing

Build 156 adds a reviewable social publishing foundation. Admin Progress can now create internal social drafts from job updates/media, Admin Social Queue can review and mark those drafts, and the schema now includes `social_channels`, `social_post_queue`, and `social_dispatch_attempts`. Direct posting to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, and other platforms is possible later after the required platform credentials, app approvals, and consent/compliance checks are in place.


## Next 20 value-added steps after Build 156

1. Run the Build 156 social queue SQL migration in Supabase.
2. Add a Social Queue card to staff role training notes so detailers know drafts are not public posts yet.
3. Decide the first direct-post platform: recommended order is Facebook/Instagram, Google Business Profile, X, TikTok, then YouTube Shorts.
4. Add per-platform caption length warnings and media-count warnings.
5. Add a privacy checklist before any customer vehicle/photo can be marked ready.
6. Add license-plate blur/cover reminder fields to the media workflow.
7. Add customer consent flags for public before/after use.
8. Add a reusable caption template library for job type, vehicle size, service area, and upsell language.
9. Add platform-specific hashtag presets for local SEO and discovery.
10. Add OAuth setup notes and token rotation guidance for each social platform.
11. Add a direct Meta/Facebook Page adapter after the app permissions are approved.
12. Add an Instagram Business publishing adapter after Meta media-container requirements are confirmed.
13. Add a Google Business Profile recent-work publishing path after the Google account scope is finalized.
14. Add a TikTok direct-post adapter only after app review and creator authorization are confirmed.
15. Add a queue calendar so posts can be scheduled by day/time.
16. Add duplicate-content warnings when the same photo/caption is queued twice.
17. Add analytics fields for clicked progress links and posted platform URLs.
18. Add customer-friendly public gallery promotion rules from approved job media.
19. Add fallback export buttons: copy caption, download media list, and open platform composer.
20. Add social performance notes back into the booking/customer history for future marketing decisions.

## Build 159 sync — social queue usability and release discipline

- Added caption/hashtag DB picker support for Admin Social Queue.
- Added planned publish time for manual drafts and schedule filtering.
- Added duplicate draft warnings using `duplicate_signature`.
- Added manual posted URL and platform post ID capture.
- Added `social_post_metrics_snapshots` schema support for future reporting.
- Release checks now require the Build 159 social template/schedule markers.

## Build 169 next-chat starting point

Start by deploying the Build 169 zip, then test `/login` with DevTools open. Expected result: `auth_me` and analytics should not show raw 500s. If login still fails, inspect the returned JSON message; the most likely causes are missing Cloudflare Supabase variables, unapplied `staff_auth_sessions` / `customer_auth_sessions` tables, or a bcrypt password hash without `bcryptjs` bundled. After login works, continue Admin Leads lead-to-quote conversion.

## Build 170 next-chat starting point

Deploy Build 170, then test signed-out and signed-in customer flows separately. Signed-out browsing should be quiet in DevTools for `/api/client/dashboard`. Signed-in `/my-account` should return `ok:true` with customer, vehicle, booking, gift certificate, and review arrays. If the signed-in dashboard is empty or signed out, prioritize customer login/session creation before adding lead-to-quote conversion.

## Build 172 handoff note

- New customer FAQ/help route: `/faq` and `/faq/index.html`.
- Access paths: top nav, footer, homepage, Services, Pricing, Contact, and sitemap.
- New FAQ DB/API foundation: `public_faq_entries`, `/api/public_faqs`, `data/site_faqs.json`.
- Next recommended build: Admin Content editor for FAQ/special/service/education copy, then persistent quotes and lead conversion.

---
> Build 174 documentation sync (2026-05-24): persistent quote/proposal drafts were added to Admin Leads with save/load APIs, SQL table foundation, schema notes, and release guard coverage. Quote starters remain copy-ready before the SQL is applied, but saved drafts require sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql.
