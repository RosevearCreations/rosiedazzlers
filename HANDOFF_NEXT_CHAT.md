# Rosie Dazzlers — Handoff for Next Chat

## Branch rule
Use dev as source of truth unless explicitly told otherwise.

## Resume prompt
Continue Rosie Dazzlers from the dev branch docs. Use README.md, PROJECT_BRAIN.md, CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md, KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md, DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md, and NEXT_STEPS_INTERNAL.md as source of truth.

## Current state in one paragraph
Rosie Dazzlers is a role-aware detailing operations platform with booking, deposits, gifts, token-based customer progress, jobsite intake/time tracking, customer/staff/admin screens, recovery messaging foundations, and DB-backed catalog/inventory foundations. The newest pass finished the live chart direction by rendering the price chart, package-details chart, and vehicle size guide as live SVG outputs from the canonical pricing helpers, while App Management now has a staff helper to preview/download those SVG charts from the current editor JSON.

## Most likely next priorities
1. Deploy and manually verify the App Management live chart preview/download helper
2. post-deploy validation of structured-data/rich-result rendering
3. customer vehicle crop/editor hardening
4. mobile admin visual regression pass for dense pricing/catalog rows
5. real staff auth/session completion on the remaining bridge paths

## Delivery style preference
- one file at a time
- brief description first
- then one complete code block for the entire file

## Newest pass summary
- added a live SVG vehicle size guide generator to assets/pricing-catalog-client.js
- switched /pricing and /services to use the live size guide before the packaged fallback image
- added an App Management live chart helper for preview/download of price, package-details, and size SVG charts
- refreshed docs and schema notes with no DDL change in this pass
