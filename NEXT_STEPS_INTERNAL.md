# Next Steps Internal

## Fresh next steps after the April 11 pass
1. Deploy and verify the repaired booking layout on real phone, tablet, and desktop widths.
2. Confirm service-area analytics appear in the admin analytics screen and exported CSVs.
3. Continue deeper accounting profitability once post-deploy booking and analytics checks are stable.
4. Keep reducing legacy bridge behavior on any internal screens still not fully session-first.


## Highest-value next build targets
1. **Staff auth/session**
   - finish real staff login/session
   - reduce reliance on shared password bridge
   - make actor resolution the trusted backend source

2. **Identity consistency**
   - unify actor linkage across intake, progress, media, time, signoff, and assignment

3. **Pricing/gift cleanup**
   - finish pricing/add-on convergence on pricing JSON
   - improve gift messaging in customer-facing screens
   - review rare reconciliation edges

4. **Upload / field UX**
   - extend the new signed-upload/session-aware pattern to other field screens
   - harden storage/public/private media strategy
   - improve mobile field workflow around media and progress

5. **Inventory / purchasing**
   - reminders
   - order receive/close states
   - optional notification-backed reorder nudges

6. **Recovery operations**
   - stronger provider dispatch history
   - manual resend/escalation options
   - richer rule validation and testing traces

7. **SEO + security on every pass**
   - continue page-by-page title/H1/meta review
   - keep admin/token/protected pages noindex
   - keep error handling and access controls moving forward each pass

## Newly moved forward
- site-wide public account widget
- client password reset + email verification token flow
- public analytics tracking and live-session visibility foundation

## Move up next
1. complete real staff auth/session across internal screens
2. finish canonical pricing/add-on convergence across every path
3. polish gift messaging across checkout and customer account surfaces
4. finish direct mobile upload flow
5. deepen reorder lifecycle from request to ordered/received/reminded
6. continue page-by-page SEO audit and structured-data cleanup



## March 25, 2026 moved forward
- DB-backed canonical pricing setting added for checkout
- session-aware signed mobile upload page added
- purchase-order lifecycle status actions added in admin catalog


### March 25, 2026 pass note
This doc was refreshed during the vehicle catalog, progress-session, layout, and public catalog filter pass. The repo now includes NHTSA-backed vehicle make/model endpoints, a DB cache table for vehicle catalog rows, progress moderation/enable session upgrades, and public search/filter cleanup on Gear and Consumables.


## April 7, 2026 membership / mobile / deploy hardening pass
- Standardized the four missing Services add-on images onto local bundled asset paths and added real PNG copies so the service cards stop depending on fragile external image URLs.
- Added route-safe admin folder entry points and stronger Pages Functions helper shims so Cloudflare deploys are less sensitive to mixed helper import paths.
- Moved customer segmentation toward a scalable membership model by seeding Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers and making new customer creation default to Bronze instead of a legacy placeholder tier.
- Continued mobile-fit and CSS hardening by tightening service-card/select sizing, overlap handling, and installable-app support through a shared install prompt + service worker path.


## April 8, 2026 admin route stabilization pass
- Repaired the current build by standardizing active admin navigation back to direct `.html` routes instead of mixed pretty-route/admin-folder assumptions.
- Restored the shared admin shell from the richer canonical copy so pages that call `window.AdminShell.boot(...)` load again.
- Removed duplicate clean-route wrapper folders for `/admin`, `/admin-catalog`, `/admin-accounting`, `/services`, and `/pricing`; `_redirects` remains the working compatibility layer.

## April 8, 2026 accounting access and admin workflow pass
- Accounting access is now surfaced directly in the Admin dashboard, shared admin menu, and shared return toolbar so office-side accounting work is no longer hidden behind direct URL knowledge alone.
- This pass moves the roadmap and known gaps forward again by improving internal shell cohesion and operational discoverability without changing the underlying accounting schema.
- Suggested next mobile/operations features: quick expense entry from phone with receipt photo attachment, vendor quick-add during payable entry, and a month-end checklist panel for settlement, remittance, and report export.

<!-- Last synchronized: April 8, 2026. Reviewed during the accounting access/admin dashboard/menu pass. -->

## April 9, 2026 next practical targets after this pass
1. **Auth/session convergence**
   - remove remaining route-by-route drift in actor/session behavior
   - make all internal screens resolve staff identity the same way
2. **Accounting polish**
   - add A/R-oriented customer statement views and better month-end checklist UX
   - improve reconciliation confidence for remittance, owner equity, and retained earnings review
3. **Inventory costing**
   - finish backfilling missing `cost_cents` on active stocked items
   - add optional mobile quick-edit for vendor + cost during receiving/reorder work
4. **Operations UX**
   - quick expense entry from phone with receipt photo attachment
   - vendor quick-add during payable entry
   - stronger export presets for accountant handoff and month-end archive


## Push next
- complete actor-id normalization on remaining progress/jobsite/annotation/signoff/time-entry tables and endpoints
- test admin vs detailer route gating live against deployed Pages/Supabase
- tighten profitability inputs with labor burden and fuller overhead allocation rules


## Newly moved up after the April 9, 2026 add-on / checklist / assignment pass
- remove more visible legacy password prompts from the remaining internal compatibility screens now that session-first handling is deeper
- extend resolved staff-user-id assignment into every remaining live/jobsite/progress route and export that still leans on names
- add vendor quick-add during payable entry
- add receipt-photo attachment for quick phone expense entry
- expand month-end checklist from one saved note into guided task links / export shortcuts / reconciliation reminders

## April 10, 2026 moved forward
- every add-on card now has a canonical primary/fallback image path again
- multi-detailer booking assignment now exists with one lead / senior-on-job plus supporting crew
- detailer job visibility now respects crew membership instead of only the single lead stored on the booking record
- assignment UI was tightened for more app-like tablet/phone use

## Move up next after this pass
1. extend crew-aware summaries into admin live/jobsite/progress/time/media list screens
2. keep converting remaining internal pages to the shared auth/session shell and reduce lingering bridge-only behavior
3. finish deeper A/R, reconciliation, and profitability polish
4. run live end-to-end verification against deployed Pages + Supabase after the new SQL migration
5. continue route-by-route local SEO cleanup, title clarity, and content relevance work

- 2026-04-11 hotfix first: verify deployed clean routes after removing duplicate static outputs, then continue the session-first migration work.


Route hotfix sync reviewed on 2026-04-11.

## April 11, 2026 moved forward
- route-hotfix-safe build structure carried forward again
- crew summary now surfaces in more internal workflow screens
- admin runtime request handling now has timeout + text fallback support
- static checks now catch temporary debug/check files before packaging

## Move up next after this pass
1. finish session-first cleanup on the remaining jobsite/time/media edge screens
2. deploy this pass and run route-by-route smoke checks on Pages immediately after publish
3. continue crew-aware detail surfaces in any remaining exports/reports that still show only one assigned name
4. keep route-by-route SEO/title/H1 cleanup going after the deployment is stable

## 2026-04-11 pass 9 sync
- Booking flow now uses a clearer service-area selector with town-level choices across Oxford and Norfolk communities.
- Booking availability shows open, partial, and unavailable dates in the next 21-day snapshot, and the date picker contrast was tightened for dark mode.
- Year / Make / Model on booking is now typeable with datalist-assisted lookup and validation against the existing vehicle catalog.
- Public analytics was deepened with richer action tracking, viewport/session details, and location/device enrichment stored inside event payloads.
- Route-collision folders and temporary check artifacts were removed again to keep Pages routing stable.
### Immediate next steps after pass 9
- Push town-level service-area wording into public services/pricing content.
- Add admin filters and exports by service-area town/zone.
- Review whether route/visit analytics should also feed recovery timing and promo targeting.

## 2026-04-11 pass 11 sync note
- Tightened the booking preferred-date control so it no longer stretches wider than needed and added a visible white picker button.
- Public booking, services, and pricing pages now read the canonical pricing catalog API first and only fall back to bundled JSON if the API is unavailable.
- App Management now includes a pricing catalog editor so package prices, included services, add-ons, service-area rules, and chart links can be maintained from one source of truth.
- No schema shape change landed in this pass; `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` was refreshed to note the pricing-catalog consolidation and booking UI tightening work.

> Pass update 2026-04-12: Re-synced the current uploaded build to the latest safe route structure. Removed duplicate clean-route folders that were reintroducing Cloudflare Pages redirect loops, preserved the newer booking experience already present in `book.html`, refreshed the deployed booking smoke check to recognize the shared `chrome.js` analytics bootstrap, and cleaned the login form autocomplete attributes. Immediate next step after deploy: verify `/`, `/services`, `/pricing`, `/book`, and `/admin` on the active branch before resuming larger feature work.

## 2026-04-13 Pass 14 Sync
- Booking screen remains stable and should not be altered in future passes unless a critical bug appears.
- `_redirects` is working and treated as complete for the current route layout.
- Pricing/packages/add-ons/service areas/travel charges continue to flow through the App Management pricing control center as the preferred single entry point.
- This pass added office-facing finance adjustments for discounts/refunds plus customer-facing document work for order confirmation, invoice / summary, gift certificate printing, and social feed management.

---

## Pass sync — 2026-04-14 (pass 16)

- Booking screen remains locked and stable.
- `_redirects` remains the working route layer and includes the admin-app trailing-slash compatibility line.
- App Management was repaired in this pass: the page now restores its missing helper functions, shows a proper internal menu mount, includes clearer feature descriptions, and exposes document/social defaults without crashing.
- Admin navigation now includes a visible path to App Management from the dashboard, shared admin menu, and return bar.
- No new database table or column changes were introduced in this pass; schema files were refreshed to reflect a no-DDL stability/documentation pass.
- Strongest next steps remain the single-entry pricing/accounting workflow, refund-credit memo document polish, and provider-tested email sending.

> Pass sync April 15, 2026: generated local price-chart PNG assets from the canonical bundled pricing catalog, rewired chart fallbacks to `/assets/brand`, added a regeneration script, and refreshed docs/schema notes for the legacy price-image carry-forward pass.

Update note — 2026-04-16 pass20: Added explicit admin route wrappers for social feed and vehicle catalog endpoints to stop Pages Function import-resolution failures on /api/admin routes. Booking remains stable; no schema DDL change in this pass.
- Pass sync 2026-04-16 (pass 21): added crew time/payroll workflow, staff availability blocks, payroll runs + accounting-post option, staff pay/work-cap settings, and service-time insight reporting; booking screen remains stable.

- Pass 22 sync: fixed admin-accounting date/input layout, moved admin-staff to a left-side internal menu layout, normalized admin login redirects to .html, and added clean admin route rewrites for payroll/staff/accounting/app/login.

## April 16, 2026 admin-nav and growth-direction pass

- standardized the top admin navigation so pages that boot through the shared admin shell now overwrite incomplete page-level nav link lists with one consistent internal menu bar plus account/logout controls.
- added new App Management sections for:
  - stronger self-serve quote + booking emphasis
  - scheduled e-gift delivery settings
  - maintenance / membership plan settings
- extended app settings loading so those three new settings keys are part of the shared office configuration pull.
- moved the public direction forward with:
  - stronger quote-first CTA messaging on the home and pricing pages
  - richer gift checkout inputs for recipient name and preferred send date
  - gift checkout metadata capture for recipient name, preferred send date, and gift message
- no schema DDL change was required for this pass; this was a workflow/settings/UI pass.

Pass sync: April 16, 2026 — top admin navigation standardized, app-management growth settings added, booking-led self-serve direction restored, and gift checkout now collects recipient name plus preferred send date.

---

## Pass 24 Sync — 2026-04-17

This pass focused on three areas:
- normalized the shared top admin navigation and repaired the off-pattern `admin-assign` header so the top menu matches the other admin screens more closely
- shifted the public self-serve direction back to a booking-led planner on the pricing page by embedding the live booking experience so customers keep the exact service-area restrictions, 21-day availability windows, slot logic, and booking aesthetics instead of using a separate quote-builder path
- continued the scheduled e-gift direction by exposing public growth settings, improving the gift message/send-date experience, and adding live recipient/delivery preview boxes on the gifts page

Schema impact for this pass: no new tables or columns. Existing `app_management_settings` is reused for public quote, e-gift, and membership display settings.

Pass sync: April 17, 2026 — pricing now restores the booking page as the first self-serve step by embedding the live booking planner on /pricing so service-area restrictions, 21-day availability windows, add-on logic, and booking aesthetics stay in one source of truth.
- 2026-04-17 pass26: extended booking-led self-serve with live embedded planner summaries on pricing and service-gift redemption preview, plus richer gift delivery metadata (sender name, preferred send date, message) through checkout, webhook, receipt, and printable certificate.

### April 17, 2026 pass27 note
- moved the next public growth step forward with a new `/maintenance-plan` page, recurring-plan waitlist capture, admin visibility for recurring reminder candidates, and stronger booking-link carry-forward from the live embedded planner.

---
Pass 28 sync — 2026-04-20
- Continued the booking-led self-serve direction instead of replacing it with a separate quote-only tool.
- Added scheduled e-gift delivery automation groundwork and live processor routes, plus printable gift lookup by code.
- Moved recurring maintenance reminders from interest-list based to customer-history based, so reminder timing now keys off completed bookings and real last-service dates while the interest list stays available for demand tracking.
- Strengthened visible live-booking / availability prompts and refreshed the documentation/schema trail for this pass.


<!-- pass29-sync: customer-history recurring maintenance reminders -->


> Pass sync April 20, 2026: customer screen raw JSON blocks were replaced with readable summaries and a visual garage layout, App Management social feeds gained a structured editor with the raw JSON moved into an advanced block, booking-led maintenance interest now requires Complete Detail selection before schedule interest capture, and customer-facing print/email correspondence styling was refined.


<!-- pass31-sync: booking overflow polish, maintenance conversion from complete detail, fleet handoff path -->
> Pass sync April 20, 2026: booking vehicle inputs and service cards were tightened to prevent text overflow, My Account now uses a real garage-bay view plus a fleet handoff path after 6 vehicles, and maintenance conversion now begins only after a completed Complete Detail with repeat-booking guidance tied to actual service history.

> Pass sync April 21, 2026: added mileage and next-service mileage capture, customer vehicle image/video library groundwork, garage-bay photo support, a public before/after slider gallery, admin vehicle-media override/delete tools, and detailer arrival geolocation capture groundwork.

## 2026-04-22 merchandising pass — local image scoring / SEO / geofence refinement

- upgraded customer vehicle media from the older rule-only score into a stronger local merchandising score that now blends file presence, dimensions, orientation, alt text, crop history, brightness, contrast, sharpness, background consistency, subject fill, duplicate-angle penalty, and a later-image lifestyle bonus
- `my-account.html` now analyzes images in-browser before upload using EXIF-aware decode, local canvas sampling, and preview guidance so customers get stronger front-end feedback before save
- the upload preview now shows a local preflight summary with background, subject fill, sharpness, brightness, contrast, and duplicate-angle hints while still allowing videos to remain a manual-review media type
- `functions/api/client/vehicle_media_save.js` now persists `media_analysis` and passes existing rows into `functions/api/_lib/vehicle-media-scoring.js` so duplicate-angle penalties can be applied at save time too
- `functions/api/_lib/booking-location.js` now prefers explicit service-area coordinates when they exist in the pricing/service-area metadata, then falls back to local service-area lookup keys and county fallback centroids
- public SEO copy was tightened again on `services.html`, `pricing.html`, `contact.html`, and `gallery.html` with clearer local-search wording while preserving a single H1 per exposed page
- schema/migration sync for this pass lives in `sql/2026-04-22_vehicle_media_merchandising_score.sql`, `sql/2026-04-21_vehicle_media_gallery_geofence.sql`, and `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`
- next-step direction is still the same operational split: local scoring + EXIF-aware orientation + guide-led framing now, optional cloud smart-assist later only if you want object recognition or damage-style analysis
