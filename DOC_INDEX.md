# Build 184 update — 20-step operations, media, and payment hardening

**Updated:** 2026-06-01  
**Build:** 184

Build 184 completes the requested next-20 pass by tightening the payment/refund operations, improving image/media readiness review, and documenting the next operational bundle. This pass is intentionally no-DDL: it uses the existing Build 180–182 payment tables and the Build 183 image requirements foundation.

## Build 184 — 20 completed items

1. Added `/admin-media-health.html` and `/admin-media-health/` so staff can review missing required photos/videos from a protected admin page.
2. Added `/api/admin/media_asset_health_scan` to scan required public R2/media URLs and return missing/not-public files with upload keys.
3. Added `data/image_requirements_build184.json` as the machine-readable source for required app, add-on, landing, gallery, and proof images.
4. Added the Media Health page to the shared Admin Menu.
5. Added Media Health access rules to `assets/admin-auth.js`.
6. Added a Media Health card to the Admin Dashboard.
7. Added `/api/admin/payment_refund_status_poll` so staff can poll Stripe/PayPal refund status and refresh local refund rows.
8. Added `/api/admin/payment_receipt_resend` so staff can requeue a customer quote-deposit receipt email from a payment request.
9. Added `/api/admin/payment_accountant_package_export` for an accountant-style payment CSV with Ontario HST allocation estimates.
10. Added an **Export accountant package** button to Admin Payments.
11. Added **Resend receipt** controls to quote deposit/payment request cards.
12. Added **Poll provider status** controls to refund record cards.
13. Kept manual refund records, provider refund initiation, webhook settlement, and replay controls on one Payments page for easier review.
14. Added `sql/2026-06-01_build184_twenty_step_ops_media_payment_no_ddl_note.sql` to document the no-DDL Build 184 schema status.
15. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` with Build 184 operational notes.
16. Updated `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md` with the Build 184 no-DDL dependency summary.
17. Updated `IMAGES.md` with the Admin Media Health scan workflow and upload review method.
18. Updated `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md` to reflect Build 184 media/payment/accounting hardening.
19. Added `scripts/build184_twenty_step_ops_media_payment_check.py` and wired it into the release check chain.
20. Re-ran the one-H1 and release guard path so exposed public pages still use one clear H1.

## Next 20 steps after Build 184

1. Deploy Build 184 and test `/admin-media-health.html` against live R2 assets.
2. Upload the missing add-on images listed in `IMAGES.md`, then re-run the Media Health scan.
3. Replace regional landing placeholders with Rosie-owned images for Tillsonburg, Woodstock/Ingersoll, Simcoe/Delhi, Port Dover, Norwich/Otterville, and Waterford/Vittoria.
4. Capture the first four approved-public before/after gallery proof sets by town/service.
5. Add real image dimension validation instead of URL-only health checks.
6. Add R2 signed upload URLs for admin media replacement so uploads can happen from the app instead of the Cloudflare dashboard only.
7. Add a media task status table so missing-image items can be assigned, marked uploaded, reviewed, and approved.
8. Add provider refund polling for payment requests without refund rows, not only existing refund records.
9. Add scheduled retry checks for pending Stripe/PayPal refunds.
10. Add payment reconciliation variance warnings for paid amount vs. quote/deposit amount.
11. Add processor fee capture and estimated net payout fields to the payment export.
12. Add HST/GST allocation review screens before accountant export is considered final.
13. Add failed receipt email retry controls and visible notification-event status on Admin Payments.
14. Add customer-facing receipt PDF/download links.
15. Add final-balance invoice/payment requests after job completion.
16. Add payment application to final invoices, deposits, refunds, and tips.
17. Add month-end payment close checklist tied to reconciled provider exports.
18. Add dashboard warnings for missing images on high-traffic public pages.
19. Add Search Console/local SEO task cards tied to missing service/town proof content.
20. Add a consolidated accountant export package that bundles payment CSV, refund CSV, journal candidates, HST summary, and close checklist.

# Build 181 handoff note — verified provider quote deposits

Build 181 adds verified Stripe/PayPal webhook settlement for accepted quote deposit/payment requests. Apply `sql/2026-05-26_build181_payment_webhooks_quote_deposits.sql` after Build 180, then test Stripe Checkout metadata settlement and PayPal verified capture settlement through `quote_deposit_payment_requests`.

# Build 178 update — Status Saves, Saved Price Reviews, Public Content Rendering & Privacy Badges

**Current build:** Build 178  
**Date:** 2026-05-25

Build 178 closes the next operational gaps after Build 177 by adding conversion-draft status saving, saved final price reviews, live rendering of Admin Content Center blocks on public pages, media privacy readiness badges in the Social Queue/App Management flow, and deeper local SEO proof recommendations. No new DDL is required; this pass depends on the Build 175 content/conversion tables and Build 177 final-price review fields.

## Completed in Build 178

1. Added `/api/admin/lead_conversion_status_save` so staff can move conversion drafts through `draft_booking`, `needs_review`, `ready_to_book`, `converted`, and `closed`.
2. Added `/api/admin/lead_conversion_price_review_save` so catalog reconciliation results can be saved before booking creation.
3. Updated `/admin-conversions.html` with Save Status and Save Price Review controls.
4. Added `/assets/public-content-blocks.js` and live public content mounts on Home, Services, Specials, Fleet, Maintenance, and Help pages.
5. Added Social Queue media privacy readiness badges using the existing media privacy summary endpoint.
6. Expanded local SEO proof reporting with concrete next-proof recommendations by town/service.
7. Added a Build 178 release guard and no-DDL SQL note.

## Updated completion status after Build 178

| Area | Status | Build 178 notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conversion draft status workflow | Stronger foundation | Status can now be saved without creating a booking. |
| Final price reconciliation | Stronger foundation | Reconciliation can be saved before booking creation. |
| Admin Content public rendering | Added foundation | DB/fallback content blocks can now render on public pages. |
| Media privacy before reuse | Stronger foundation | Social/Admin flows now show privacy readiness reminders. |
| Local SEO proof reporting | Stronger foundation | Report now recommends next town/service proof to create. |

## Remaining priority after Build 178

1. Add a fuller conversion-draft detail page with audit history.
2. Render saved content blocks into exact page sections rather than only generic cards.
3. Add admin approval gates that block publish/API actions unless consent and privacy statuses are approved.
4. Turn proof recommendations into assignable content/media tasks.
5. Add quote/proposal email delivery and customer acceptance tracking.

# Build 177 update — Conversion Review Queue, Price Reconciliation & Local Proof Reporting

**Updated:** 2026-05-25  
**Current build:** Build 177  
**Primary source of truth:** `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

Build 177 closes the next workflow gap after Build 176 by adding a dedicated `/admin-conversions.html` review queue. Staff can now review all lead conversion drafts in one place, reconcile final package/add-on/travel/HST pricing from the pricing catalog, confirm the required booking fields, and create a live booking only after the draft is ready. Build 177 also adds local SEO proof reporting that counts only privacy-approved before/after examples by town and service.

## Completed in Build 177

1. Added `/admin-conversions.html` and `/admin-conversions/` as a protected conversion-draft review queue.
2. Added `/api/admin/lead_conversion_price_reconcile` for catalog-backed package/add-on/travel/HST/deposit review before booking creation.
3. Added `/api/admin/local_seo_proof_report` for privacy-approved town/service proof coverage reporting.
4. Updated Admin Analytics with a **Local SEO proof coverage** card.
5. Updated public Gallery cards with clearer consent/privacy badges.
6. Added optional final-price review fields to `public.lead_conversion_drafts` via `sql/2026-05-25_build177_conversion_review_price_local_proof.sql`.
7. Updated Admin Dashboard, Admin Menu, Admin Shell, and Admin Leads access paths so the Conversion Queue is easy to find.
8. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`, `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md`, and release guards.

## Updated completion status after Build 177

| COMPETETIVE.md area | Current status | Build 177 notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lead → booking workflow | Stronger foundation | Dedicated review queue now separates draft review from the lead card UI. |
| Final price reconciliation | Added foundation | Catalog-backed package/add-on/travel/HST review is available before creating a real booking. |
| Quote/booking status workflow | Improved | Conversion drafts can be filtered/reviewed before becoming live booking rows. |
| Admin-managed content | Partial but improved | FAQ and reusable content blocks exist; page-specific live rendering remains next. |
| Service/town proof reporting | Added foundation | Analytics now reports approved proof coverage by target town/service. |
| Media privacy enforcement | Improved | Public Gallery shows consent/privacy badges and still filters non-approved media. |
| Conversion analytics | Improved | Lead/quote summary exists and local proof coverage was added to Admin Analytics. |

## Remaining competitive gap priority after Build 177

1. Save final price reconciliation payloads directly from `/admin-conversions.html` before booking creation.
2. Add a dedicated conversion-draft status update endpoint for `needs_review`, `ready_to_book`, `converted`, and `closed`.
3. Add visible privacy badges beside every admin gallery/social publish action, not only public gallery and App Management warnings.
4. Render Admin Content Center blocks live on public Specials, service, homepage, fleet, maintenance, and Help pages.
5. Add town/service proof dashboards that recommend the next local page or gallery item to create.
6. Add customer-facing quote/proposal send and acceptance tracking.

# Build 174 update — Admin Leads quote/proposal drafts

**Updated:** 2026-05-24  
**Current build:** Build 174  
**Primary source of truth:** `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

Build 174 completes the next open competitive-matrix item after the quote starter: staff can now save generated quote starter text as a persistent quote/proposal draft from `/admin-leads.html`. This moves the workflow from copy-only follow-up toward a real quote pipeline while staying fallback-safe if the new table has not been applied yet.

## Completed in Build 174

1. Added `/api/admin/quote_proposal_drafts_save` for staff-protected quote/proposal draft creation and updates.
2. Added `/api/admin/quote_proposal_drafts_list` for staff-protected draft lookup by lead, booking, status, search, or id.
3. Updated `/admin-leads.html` and `/admin-leads/index.html` with **Save quote draft** and **Load drafts** actions on each public lead.
4. Added persistent draft display directly under the lead card so staff can see saved follow-up text before contacting a customer.
5. Added migration-safe fallback messages when the new draft table has not been applied yet.
6. Added SQL migration `sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql`.
7. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` and `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md` with the quote/proposal draft table plan.
8. Added release guard `scripts/quote_proposal_drafts_build174_check.py` and wired it into `scripts/release_check.py`.
9. Re-ran Cloudflare Functions checks, one-H1 validation, and release checks.

## Active next steps after Build 174

1. Apply `sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql` after the Build 167/168 lead SQL.
2. Browser-test `/admin-leads.html` by building a quote starter, saving it as a draft, and loading it again.
3. Add draft status controls for `needs_review`, `ready_to_send`, `sent`, `accepted`, and `declined`.
4. Add one-click lead → draft booking/quote conversion.
5. Add package/add-on price suggestions from the live pricing catalog.
6. Extend Admin Content Center to specials, service blurbs, homepage cards, and help articles.
7. Add service/town-aware proof filtering and media privacy enforcement before public gallery/social use.

# Build 165 sync — Booking photo-estimate link capture

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 165 adds a public Booking Step 4 photo-estimate link field, sends the links through checkout, stores them in notes as a fallback, writes to optional `bookings.photo_estimate_links` when migrated, and shows clickable links in Admin Booking intake review. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 164 sync — Admin booking intake review actions

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 164 adds staff action controls to Admin Booking for photo-estimate status, condition-review status, media/privacy status, privacy checklist flags, blur/crop flags, and a staff intake-review note. The action writes directly to optional booking fields when the Build 162/163/164 migrations are applied and falls back to booking notes if the optional columns are not live yet. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 163 sync — booking intake admin review

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

---

# Build 160 doc-index note

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

Planning source of truth: `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`. Competitor/service reference: `COMPETETIVE.md`. Build 160 audit: `COMPETITOR_SANITY_CHECK.md`. Aliases were added as `COMPETITOR.md` and `COMPETETOR.md` so future chats can find the file even if the name is typed differently.

---
> Build 174 documentation sync (2026-05-24): persistent quote/proposal drafts were added to Admin Leads with save/load APIs, SQL table foundation, schema notes, and release guard coverage. Quote starters remain copy-ready before the SQL is applied, but saved drafts require sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql.


## Build 175 update — lead conversion, pricing suggestions, content expansion, gallery privacy, and analytics

- Added safe lead → draft booking/quote conversion using `public.lead_conversion_drafts` instead of creating live scheduled bookings too early.

---

## Build 179 documentation sync — publish blocking, proof tasks, quote acceptance

Build 179 adds hard social publish blocking before webhook/API/manual posted actions, assignable local SEO proof tasks from proof recommendations, and customer-facing quote/proposal delivery plus accept/decline tracking. Schema tracking now points to `sql/2026-05-26_build179_publish_block_tasks_quote_acceptance.sql`. The one-H1 SEO rule, local service/town wording, and fallback-safe API pattern remain required on every pass.

---

### Build 180 update — accepted quote deposit/payment request and final booking confirmation

Build 180 connects the accepted quote workflow to a safer payment-request foundation. Staff can create a tracked deposit/payment request from an accepted quote/proposal draft, share the private `/quote-payment.html` customer page, mark deposits paid from Admin Leads, and link or confirm the final booking when a booking row is available. Schema tracking was updated for `public.quote_deposit_payment_requests` and the quote/conversion deposit status fields.
---

> Build 181 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added verified Stripe/PayPal webhook settlement for `quote_deposit_payment_requests`, PayPal quote-deposit order/capture support, automatic deposit-paid updates, booking confirmation linking, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard and local service/town wording rules remain required on every pass.

> Build 182 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added quote-deposit webhook event history, verified-event replay controls, customer receipt email queueing, manual/provider refund and partial-refund tracking, `/admin-payments.html`, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, and Markdown/schema synchronization remain required on every pass.

---

## Build 183 documentation sync — direct refunds, reconciliation export, webhook warnings, and image requirements

Build 183 adds direct Stripe/PayPal refund initiation from Admin Payments, a payment reconciliation CSV export, dashboard/payment-page warnings for failed or unverified webhook events, and a cleared/rebuilt `IMAGES.md` with missing image/video requirements and upload methods. This build is no-DDL and depends on the Build 180–182 payment tables. SEO/H1, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, schema tracking, and Markdown synchronization remain required on every pass.

## Build 186 - verified water restrictions and next-20 planning sync (2026-06-02)

Build 186 corrected the service-area water-use guidance after source verification. Oxford County / Tillsonburg now uses the May 1-September 30 rule under Oxford County By-law No. 4193-2002: outdoor water use by hose or attachment, including vehicle washing and power washing, follows address parity, with residential hours of 6:00-9:00 a.m. or 6:00-9:00 p.m. and commercial/industrial hours of 8:00-10:00 a.m. or 3:00-5:00 p.m. Norfolk County now uses the May 15-September 15 Water Restriction By-law rule: 9:00-11:00 a.m. and 7:00-10:00 p.m., with odd/even house-number days and the first-24-hours sod exemption note.

## Build 187 Sync — Verified Local Page Water Rules (2026-06-03)

- Reverified Oxford/Tillsonburg, Woodstock/Oxford, and Norfolk water-use restrictions from official public sources.
- Corrected the static town landing-page shell so `/tillsonburg-auto-detailing/` and every other local page shows the water-use note even before client-side rendering.
- Added server-side landing-page enforcement so stale Admin App/DB landing-page rows cannot hide the corrected water-rule note.
- Added `data/water_restriction_rules_build187.json`, updated service-area/local SEO data, and added a no-DDL SQL note.
- Added a Build 187 release guard to check every local page for the correct Oxford/Norfolk water-rule language.

## Build 188 documentation sync — 2026-06-04

Build 188 replaces hard-coded municipal water-rule wording with a DB-first editable authority and one stable JSON fallback. The immediate `landing_pages_public.js` Worker startup crash is fixed without reintroducing mutable rule text into JavaScript. See `EDITABLE_CONTENT_SANITY_CHECK.md` and `data/editable_content_registry_build188.json` for the broader hard-coding audit.

## Build 188 documentation additions

- `EDITABLE_CONTENT_SANITY_CHECK.md` — architectural audit of mutable content/configuration.
- `data/editable_content_registry_build188.json` — machine-readable content authority registry.
- `data/water_restriction_rules.json` — stable deploy fallback for editable water rules.
- `sql/2026-06-04_build188_editable_water_rules_hardcoding_audit.sql` — DB-first water-rule authority.
