# Rosie Dazzlers — App Management Screen Plan

This document captures the current split between Customer, Detailer, Senior Detailer, and Admin screens.

## Current policy
- Blocking time is Admin-only.
- Staff management is Admin-only.
- Manual schedule changes should remain Admin-only for now.
- Customer garage is self-managed by the client, but Admin can review it.
- Customer private admin notes should not be visible to detailers.
- Detailer private admin notes should not be visible to other detailers.

## Screen direction

### Customer
- garage of vehicles
- per-vehicle preferences
- live updates / progress thread
- booking history
- gift certificates and redemption history

### Detailer
- assigned-job workspace
- observation thread posting
- customer-facing notes only where allowed
- personal profile, hours, payout/tip history

### Admin
- everything detailers see where appropriate
- plus private notes
- plus role/pay/supervisor fields
- plus app management and time blocking


## Current snapshot — March 21, 2026

Latest pass completed:
- fixed booking add-on checkbox/text layout pressure
- improved service/package image fallback with extra photo cards
- expanded staff management toward richer Admin/Detailer profile editing
- added customer tier discount support in the UI/data model direction
- added/confirmed garage, gift, and redemption visibility in client/admin screens
- added current SQL for tier discounts and richer staff/customer fields

Current next priorities:
- picture-first observation interface
- richer client/detailer threaded comments UI
- manual scheduling / app-management rules UI completion
- final layout polish across booking and internal screens

Route hotfix sync reviewed on 2026-04-11.

## 2026-04-11 pass 9 sync
- Booking flow now uses a clearer service-area selector with town-level choices across Oxford and Norfolk communities.
- Booking availability shows open, partial, and unavailable dates in the next 21-day snapshot, and the date picker contrast was tightened for dark mode.
- Year / Make / Model on booking is now typeable with datalist-assisted lookup and validation against the existing vehicle catalog.
- Public analytics was deepened with richer action tracking, viewport/session details, and location/device enrichment stored inside event payloads.
- Route-collision folders and temporary check artifacts were removed again to keep Pages routing stable.

## 2026-04-11 pass 11 sync note
- Tightened the booking preferred-date control so it no longer stretches wider than needed and added a visible white picker button.
- Public booking, services, and pricing pages now read the canonical pricing catalog API first and only fall back to bundled JSON if the API is unavailable.
- App Management now includes a pricing catalog editor so package prices, included services, add-ons, service-area rules, and chart links can be maintained from one source of truth.
- No schema shape change landed in this pass; `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` was refreshed to note the pricing-catalog consolidation and booking UI tightening work.

> Pass update 2026-04-12: Re-synced the current uploaded build to the latest safe route structure. Removed duplicate clean-route folders that were reintroducing Cloudflare Pages redirect loops, preserved the newer booking experience already present in `book.html`, refreshed the deployed booking smoke check to recognize the shared `chrome.js` analytics bootstrap, and cleaned the login form autocomplete attributes. Immediate next step after deploy: verify `/`, `/services`, `/pricing`, `/book`, and `/admin` on the active branch before resuming larger feature work.

## 2026-04-13 Pass 14 Sync
- Booking screen remains stable and should not be altered in future passes unless a critical bug appears.
- `_redirects` is working and treated as complete for the current route layout.
- Pricing/packages/add-ons/service areas/travel charges continue to flow through the App Management pricing control center as the preferred single entry point.
- This pass added office-facing finance adjustments for discounts/refunds plus customer-facing document work for order confirmation, invoice / summary, gift certificate printing, and social feed management.

---

## Pass sync — 2026-04-14 (pass 16)

- Booking screen remains locked and stable.
- `_redirects` remains the working route layer and includes the admin-app trailing-slash compatibility line.
- App Management was repaired in this pass: the page now restores its missing helper functions, shows a proper internal menu mount, includes clearer feature descriptions, and exposes document/social defaults without crashing.
- Admin navigation now includes a visible path to App Management from the dashboard, shared admin menu, and return bar.
- No new database table or column changes were introduced in this pass; schema files were refreshed to reflect a no-DDL stability/documentation pass.
- Strongest next steps remain the single-entry pricing/accounting workflow, refund-credit memo document polish, and provider-tested email sending.

> Pass sync April 15, 2026: generated local price-chart PNG assets from the canonical bundled pricing catalog, rewired chart fallbacks to `/assets/brand`, added a regeneration script, and refreshed docs/schema notes for the legacy price-image carry-forward pass.

Update note — 2026-04-16 pass20: Added explicit admin route wrappers for social feed and vehicle catalog endpoints to stop Pages Function import-resolution failures on /api/admin routes. Booking remains stable; no schema DDL change in this pass.
- Pass sync 2026-04-16 (pass 21): added crew time/payroll workflow, staff availability blocks, payroll runs + accounting-post option, staff pay/work-cap settings, and service-time insight reporting; booking screen remains stable.
