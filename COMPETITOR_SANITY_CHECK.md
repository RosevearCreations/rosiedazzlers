# Build 184 update — 20-step operations, media, and payment hardening

**Updated:** 2026-06-01  
**Build:** 184

Build 184 completes the requested next-20 pass by tightening the payment/refund operations, improving image/media readiness review, and documenting the next operational bundle. This pass is intentionally no-DDL: it uses the existing Build 180–182 payment tables and the Build 183 image requirements foundation.

## Build 184 — 20 completed items

1. Added `/admin-media-health.html` and `/admin-media-health/` so staff can review missing required photos/videos from a protected admin page.
2. Added `/api/admin/media_asset_health_scan` to scan required public R2/media URLs and return missing/not-public files with upload keys.
3. Added `data/image_requirements_build184.json` as the machine-readable source for required app, add-on, landing, gallery, and proof images.
4. Added the Media Health page to the shared Admin Menu.
5. Added Media Health access rules to `assets/admin-auth.js`.
6. Added a Media Health card to the Admin Dashboard.
7. Added `/api/admin/payment_refund_status_poll` so staff can poll Stripe/PayPal refund status and refresh local refund rows.
8. Added `/api/admin/payment_receipt_resend` so staff can requeue a customer quote-deposit receipt email from a payment request.
9. Added `/api/admin/payment_accountant_package_export` for an accountant-style payment CSV with Ontario HST allocation estimates.
10. Added an **Export accountant package** button to Admin Payments.
11. Added **Resend receipt** controls to quote deposit/payment request cards.
12. Added **Poll provider status** controls to refund record cards.
13. Kept manual refund records, provider refund initiation, webhook settlement, and replay controls on one Payments page for easier review.
14. Added `sql/2026-06-01_build184_twenty_step_ops_media_payment_no_ddl_note.sql` to document the no-DDL Build 184 schema status.
15. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` with Build 184 operational notes.
16. Updated `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md` with the Build 184 no-DDL dependency summary.
17. Updated `IMAGES.md` with the Admin Media Health scan workflow and upload review method.
18. Updated `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md` to reflect Build 184 media/payment/accounting hardening.
19. Added `scripts/build184_twenty_step_ops_media_payment_check.py` and wired it into the release check chain.
20. Re-ran the one-H1 and release guard path so exposed public pages still use one clear H1.

## Next 20 steps after Build 184

1. Deploy Build 184 and test `/admin-media-health.html` against live R2 assets.
2. Upload the missing add-on images listed in `IMAGES.md`, then re-run the Media Health scan.
3. Replace regional landing placeholders with Rosie-owned images for Tillsonburg, Woodstock/Ingersoll, Simcoe/Delhi, Port Dover, Norwich/Otterville, and Waterford/Vittoria.
4. Capture the first four approved-public before/after gallery proof sets by town/service.
5. Add real image dimension validation instead of URL-only health checks.
6. Add R2 signed upload URLs for admin media replacement so uploads can happen from the app instead of the Cloudflare dashboard only.
7. Add a media task status table so missing-image items can be assigned, marked uploaded, reviewed, and approved.
8. Add provider refund polling for payment requests without refund rows, not only existing refund records.
9. Add scheduled retry checks for pending Stripe/PayPal refunds.
10. Add payment reconciliation variance warnings for paid amount vs. quote/deposit amount.
11. Add processor fee capture and estimated net payout fields to the payment export.
12. Add HST/GST allocation review screens before accountant export is considered final.
13. Add failed receipt email retry controls and visible notification-event status on Admin Payments.
14. Add customer-facing receipt PDF/download links.
15. Add final-balance invoice/payment requests after job completion.
16. Add payment application to final invoices, deposits, refunds, and tips.

19. Add Search Console/local SEO task cards tied to missing service/town proof content.
20. Add a consolidated accountant export package that bundles payment CSV, refund CSV, journal candidates, HST summary, and close checklist.

# Build 174 update — Admin Leads quote/proposal drafts

**Updated:** 2026-05-24  
**Current build:** Build 174  
**Primary source of truth:** `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

Build 174 completes the next open competitive-matrix item after the quote starter: staff can now save generated quote starter text as a persistent quote/proposal draft from `/admin-leads.html`. This moves the workflow from copy-only follow-up toward a real quote pipeline while staying fallback-safe if the new table has not been applied yet.

## Completed in Build 174

1. Added `/api/admin/quote_proposal_drafts_save` for staff-protected quote/proposal draft creation and updates.
2. Added `/api/admin/quote_proposal_drafts_list` for staff-protected draft lookup by lead, booking, status, search, or id.
3. Updated `/admin-leads.html` and `/admin-leads/index.html` with **Save quote draft** and **Load drafts** actions on each public lead.
4. Added persistent draft display directly under the lead card so staff can see saved follow-up text before contacting a customer.
5. Added migration-safe fallback messages when the new draft table has not been applied yet.
6. Added SQL migration `sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql`.
7. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` and `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md` with the quote/proposal draft table plan.
8. Added release guard `scripts/quote_proposal_drafts_build174_check.py` and wired it into `scripts/release_check.py`.
9. Re-ran Cloudflare Functions checks, one-H1 validation, and release checks.

## Active next steps after Build 174

1. Apply `sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql` after the Build 167/168 lead SQL.
2. Browser-test `/admin-leads.html` by building a quote starter, saving it as a draft, and loading it again.
3. Add draft status controls for `needs_review`, `ready_to_send`, `sent`, `accepted`, and `declined`.
4. Add one-click lead → draft booking/quote conversion.
5. Add package/add-on price suggestions from the live pricing catalog.
6. Extend Admin Content Center to specials, service blurbs, homepage cards, and help articles.
7. Add service/town-aware proof filtering and media privacy enforcement before public gallery/social use.

---
> Build 173 documentation sync (2026-05-24): Admin Content Center, FAQ editor APIs, expanded Help Articles access/content, public Help nav link, and schema no-DDL note were updated. See `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md`, and `SANITY_CHECK.md` for the active plan.

> Build 172 documentation sync (2026-05-24): Public FAQ page/content access, `/api/public_faqs`, `public_faq_entries` SQL foundation, sitemap/nav/footer links, and competitive-matrix status were updated. See `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, and `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md` for the active plan.

# Build 171 documentation sync note

**Updated:** 2026-05-24

This Markdown file was reviewed during the Build 171 pass. Current source of truth remains `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`. Build 171 adds the Admin Leads quote-starter workflow and no new DDL.

---
# Build 167 update

Build 167 sanity note: the public competitor journey now includes structured quote/maintenance forms and direct upload foundation; remaining gaps are admin leads, quote builder, media review, DB content, and proof filtering.

---

# Build 166 sync — COMPETETIVE.md completion pass

**Updated:** 2026-05-23

Build 166 attempts to complete the public-facing items from `COMPETETIVE.md` by adding public routes for specials, gift cards, fleet, maintenance, and education, expanding the add-on catalog, adding sticky CTAs, updating Services/Homepage routing, and documenting status in `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md`. `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` remains the source of truth.


---

# Build 165 sync — Booking photo-estimate link capture

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 165 adds a public Booking Step 4 photo-estimate link field, sends the links through checkout, stores them in notes as a fallback, writes to optional `bookings.photo_estimate_links` when migrated, and shows clickable links in Admin Booking intake review. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 164 sync — Admin booking intake review actions

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 164 adds staff action controls to Admin Booking for photo-estimate status, condition-review status, media/privacy status, privacy checklist flags, blur/crop flags, and a staff intake-review note. The action writes directly to optional booking fields when the Build 162/163/164 migrations are applied and falls back to booking notes if the optional columns are not live yet. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 163 sync — booking intake admin review

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

Build 163 adds fallback-safe direct booking intake field storage and a staff-facing Admin Booking panel for estimate intake, condition-helper recommendations, media-consent preference, and privacy-review status hints. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 161 competitor sanity-check follow-up

Build 161 implements the next conversion-path step from the Build 160 sanity check: clearer package aliases, a Booking service chooser, and stronger photo-estimate guidance. The remaining competitor-aligned priorities are condition-based recommendations, photo upload/lead capture, consent/privacy workflow, FAQ/proof expansion, and DB-first service content.

---

# Competitor Sanity Check — Build 160

**Updated:** 2026-05-21  
**Source document reviewed:** `COMPETETIVE.md`  
**Roadmap authority:** `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

## Purpose

This file captures the sanity check requested before continuing feature work. `COMPETETIVE.md` describes the target website/app experience: a clearer local service hub, stronger service/category pages, easier booking decisions, proof/reviews, gift cards, specials, social proof, and admin controls. Build 160 turns that into a prioritized implementation plan and keeps `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` as the one source of truth.

## Current website/app position

### Strong or mostly present

| Area | Current state | Build 160 decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local service foundation | Homepage, Services, Pricing, Booking, Gallery, About, Contact, town pages, and key service landing pages exist. | Keep improving local wording and proof blocks rather than rebuilding from scratch. |
| One-H1 SEO habit | Release check guards against exposed HTML pages with more than one H1. | Continue every pass. |
| Core service pages | Paint correction, ceramic coating, pet hair removal, odor removal, headlight restoration, clay/sealant/polish add-on pages exist. | Add missing FAQ/proof/expectation details before expanding more pages. |
| Booking/pricing engine | Live planner, vehicle size, add-ons, availability, service-area logic, and admin pricing/catalog foundations exist. | Improve package recommendation and photo-estimate guidance next. |
| Admin app | Admin catalog, app settings, service/page editing, social queue, job/progress, accounting, payroll, booking blocks, and media tools exist. | Consolidate public service content into DB/admin-managed source over time. |
| Social workflow | Draft queue, review gates, planned publish time, template/hashtag pickers, duplicate warnings, and publish/webhook attempt path exist. | Add consent capture, media privacy/blur status, and platform previews next. |
| Proof assets | Before/after gallery, recent work mount, reviews fallback, local pages, and media library foundations exist. | Make proof service/town-aware and admin-managed. |

### Partial or needs tightening

| Area | Gap | Desired outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service hub clarity | Services page has package cards, but the competitor roadmap wants a simpler decision path first. | Add “which service should we choose?” guidance above package cards. |
| Package naming | Current packages do not exactly map to Express Interior Refresh / Full Interior Detail / Interior Detail Pro / Exterior Wash & Protect / Full Detail. | Add display aliases or service tiers without breaking existing pricing codes. |
| Photo estimate path | Booking supports media/progress pieces, but public “send photos for estimate” needs stronger CTA and routing. | Add clear quote/photo estimate CTA across Services, Booking, and Contact. |
| Specials | Seasonal/multi-vehicle/senior/fleet/headlight special ideas exist in roadmap, but not as a mature content module. | Add admin-managed specials/promos cards tied to public pages. |
| Gift cards | Gifts exist, but service-specific gift merchandising needs stronger public copy. | Add Interior Detail, Full Detail, and custom amount gift cards as clear cards. |
| FAQ and customer education | Some landing pages include educational copy, but FAQ coverage is inconsistent. | Add structured FAQ blocks to high-value pages. |
| Reviews/proof | Recent work and gallery exist, but not automatically filtered by town/service. | Filter reviews/recent work by town, service, and add-on where possible. |
| Admin content authority | Some public content still comes from static JSON/HTML. | Move high-change service, add-on, proof, and specials content toward DB-first admin controls. |

### Missing or future work

| Area | Missing capability | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package recommender | Customer answers do not yet generate a clear recommended package/add-on bundle. | Reduces confusion and improves conversion. |
| Consent-driven public media | Social queue has staff review gates, but booking/progress consent capture still needs completion. | Protects customer privacy before social or gallery use. |
| Media privacy status | No full plate/face/address blur/crop workflow yet. | Needed before scaling social and public gallery automation. |
| Social performance reporting | Schema exists for metrics snapshots, but dashboards/forms need completion. | Lets Rosie Dazzlers learn which posts drive bookings. |
| GBP/Search Console reporting | Not connected into admin analytics yet. | Helps measure local relevance/prominence work. |
| Clean repo replacement | GitHub web uploads can leave stale files. | A clean/orphan branch replacement should happen after deploy stability. |

## Competitor-roadmap priority ranking

1. **Highest conversion impact:** Service chooser, quote/photo CTA, clearer package aliases, booking recommender.
2. **Highest local SEO impact:** Town/service proof filtering, FAQ blocks, specials/gifts pages, GBP/Search Console reporting.
3. **Highest operational impact:** DB-first service content, admin-managed specials/gifts/proof, stronger fallback/error health panels.
4. **Highest safety/compliance impact:** consent capture, media privacy/blur status, owner approval roles for social publishing.
5. **Highest long-term cleanup impact:** clean repo branch, stale file retirement, JSON-to-DB migration for duplicated service content.

> Build 174 documentation sync (2026-05-24): persistent quote/proposal drafts were added to Admin Leads with save/load APIs, SQL table foundation, schema notes, and release guard coverage. Quote starters remain copy-ready before the SQL is applied, but saved drafts require sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql.


## Build 175 update — lead conversion, pricing suggestions, content expansion, gallery privacy, and analytics

- Added safe lead → draft booking/quote conversion using `public.lead_conversion_drafts` instead of creating live scheduled bookings too early.
- Added catalog-backed package/add-on price suggestions for Admin Leads from the current pricing catalog.
- Added quote draft status workflow controls: draft, needs review, ready to send, sent, accepted, declined, archived.
- Expanded Admin Content Center beyond FAQ with reusable content blocks for specials, service blurbs, homepage cards, help articles, trust proof, fleet, and maintenance copy.

- Added Admin Analytics cards for FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion summary using `/api/admin/conversion_funnel_summary`.
- Added App Management media privacy readiness warnings using `/api/admin/media_privacy_review_summary` so gallery/social reuse is checked before publishing.
- Preserved the one-H1 exposed-page rule and kept local SEO wording/access paths focused on Oxford/Norfolk service discovery.
- Added Build 176 SQL/schema notes for `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_booking_id` and `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_at`.
> Build 177 documentation sync (2026-05-25): added protected conversion-draft review queue, catalog-backed final price reconciliation, local SEO proof coverage reporting, public gallery privacy badges, SQL/schema notes, and release guard coverage.

---

## Build 179 documentation sync — publish blocking, proof tasks, quote acceptance

Build 179 adds hard social publish blocking before webhook/API/manual posted actions, assignable local SEO proof tasks from proof recommendations, and customer-facing quote/proposal delivery plus accept/decline tracking. Schema tracking now points to `sql/2026-05-26_build179_publish_block_tasks_quote_acceptance.sql`. The one-H1 SEO rule, local service/town wording, and fallback-safe API pattern remain required on every pass.

---

### Build 180 update — accepted quote deposit/payment request and final booking confirmation

Build 180 connects the accepted quote workflow to a safer payment-request foundation. Staff can create a tracked deposit/payment request from an accepted quote/proposal draft, share the private `/quote-payment.html` customer page, mark deposits paid from Admin Leads, and link or confirm the final booking when a booking row is available. Schema tracking was updated for `public.quote_deposit_payment_requests` and the quote/conversion deposit status fields.
---

> Build 181 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added verified Stripe/PayPal webhook settlement for `quote_deposit_payment_requests`, PayPal quote-deposit order/capture support, automatic deposit-paid updates, booking confirmation linking, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard and local service/town wording rules remain required on every pass.

> Build 182 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added quote-deposit webhook event history, verified-event replay controls, customer receipt email queueing, manual/provider refund and partial-refund tracking, `/admin-payments.html`, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, and Markdown/schema synchronization remain required on every pass.

---

## Build 183 documentation sync — direct refunds, reconciliation export, webhook warnings, and image requirements

Build 183 adds direct Stripe/PayPal refund initiation from Admin Payments, a payment reconciliation CSV export, dashboard/payment-page warnings for failed or unverified webhook events, and a cleared/rebuilt `IMAGES.md` with missing image/video requirements and upload methods. This build is no-DDL and depends on the Build 180–182 payment tables. SEO/H1, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, schema tracking, and Markdown synchronization remain required on every pass.

## Build 186 - verified water restrictions and next-20 planning sync (2026-06-02)

Build 186 corrected the service-area water-use guidance after source verification. Oxford County / Tillsonburg now uses the May 1-September 30 rule under Oxford County By-law No. 4193-2002: outdoor water use by hose or attachment, including vehicle washing and power washing, follows address parity, with residential hours of 6:00-9:00 a.m. or 6:00-9:00 p.m. and commercial/industrial hours of 8:00-10:00 a.m. or 3:00-5:00 p.m. Norfolk County now uses the May 15-September 15 Water Restriction By-law rule: 9:00-11:00 a.m. and 7:00-10:00 p.m., with odd/even house-number days and the first-24-hours sod exemption note.

11. Add booking-time validation that reminds staff when a requested appointment conflicts with local water-use windows.
12. Add a customer-facing note that Rosie Dazzlers can bring water/power when needed, but municipal rules still need checking.
13. Add per-town temporary notice overrides for drought/emergency restrictions.
14. Add a service-area rule version field in Supabase.
15. Add admin change history for service-area rule edits.

19. Continue media work from Build 185: R2 direct uploads, media approval transitions, and missing-media warnings.
20. Continue accountant export work: HST summary, journal candidates, receipts, and close checklist packaging.


## Build 187 Sync — Verified Local Page Water Rules (2026-06-03)

- Reverified Oxford/Tillsonburg, Woodstock/Oxford, and Norfolk water-use restrictions from official public sources.
- Corrected the static town landing-page shell so `/tillsonburg-auto-detailing/` and every other local page shows the water-use note even before client-side rendering.
- Added server-side landing-page enforcement so stale Admin App/DB landing-page rows cannot hide the corrected water-rule note.
- Added `data/water_restriction_rules_build187.json`, updated service-area/local SEO data, and added a no-DDL SQL note.
- Added a Build 187 release guard to check every local page for the correct Oxford/Norfolk water-rule language.

## Build 188 documentation sync — 2026-06-04

Build 188 replaces hard-coded municipal water-rule wording with a DB-first editable authority and one stable JSON fallback. The immediate `landing_pages_public.js` Worker startup crash is fixed without reintroducing mutable rule text into JavaScript. See `EDITABLE_CONTENT_SANITY_CHECK.md` and `data/editable_content_registry_build188.json` for the broader hard-coding audit.

## Build 189 — Editable site settings and hard-coding reduction (2026-06-04)

This pass moves the next high-priority mutable content/configuration domains out of hard-coded JavaScript and into DB-first app-management settings with stable JSON fallbacks. Completed items:

1. Extracted large default landing-page fallback content from `functions/api/landing_pages_public.js` into `data/landing_pages_content.json`.
2. Added `functions/api/data/landing_pages_content.json` so Cloudflare Functions can import the same stable fallback.
3. Moved add-on landing-page templates out of JavaScript into the landing-page content fallback.
4. Added editable `business_profile` fallback data for identity, contact, social links, and structured-data values.
5. Added editable `site_policies` fallback data for deposit, cancellation, refund, driveway, water, power, and media privacy copy.
6. Added editable `document_templates` fallback data for notification, receipt, refund, quote, proposal, invoice, and confirmation templates.
7. Added editable `business_hours_holidays` fallback data for hours, closure days, and availability notes.
8. Added editable `navigation_footer` fallback data for top navigation and footer links.
9. Exposed dropdown/option libraries through the editable settings registry.

13. Added protected `/api/admin/editable_site_settings` for staff editing.
14. Added public `/api/site_settings_public` for safe front-end consumption.
15. Added `/admin-site-settings.html` and `/admin-site-settings/` as the protected editor bridge.
16. Added Admin Menu and Admin Auth access for the new editor page.
17. Added `sql/2026-06-04_build189_editable_site_settings_foundation.sql`.
18. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` and `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md`.
19. Updated `EDITABLE_CONTENT_SANITY_CHECK.md` and `data/editable_content_registry_build188.json`.
20. Added `scripts/build189_editable_site_settings_check.py` and wired it into `scripts/release_check.py`.

Next 20 steps after Build 189:

1. Deploy Build 189.
2. Apply `sql/2026-06-04_build189_editable_site_settings_foundation.sql`.
3. Open `/admin-site-settings.html` and verify all editable domains load.
4. Save one small test edit to `business_profile`.
5. Save one small test edit to `site_policies`.
6. Sync the full landing-page fallback payload into `app_management_settings.landing_pages_content` only after reviewing size/performance.
7. Move live landing-page editor controls from raw JSON into a structured form.
8. Render public business profile values into structured data and page footer from `/api/site_settings_public`.
9. Render editable navigation/footer links from `navigation_footer`.

11. Wire document templates into quote delivery, deposit receipts, refund notices, invoices, and final confirmations.
12. Add business-hours and holiday-closure checks to booking availability.
13. Replace scattered hard-coded dropdown values with `option_libraries`.
14. Add analytics event validation against `analytics_event_registry`.
15. Replace build-specific media requirement checks with stable `media_requirements`.
16. Add a one-click “sync bundled JSON into DB setting” control for each editable domain.
17. Add setting version history or audit events.
18. Add field-level validation for each editable setting.
19. Add a public settings cache/version badge in Admin Diagnostics.
20. Continue moving remaining large inline page/content objects into DB-managed content blocks.

## Build 190 - Editable settings live rendering and diagnostics

Build 190 continues the editable-content migration by rendering public business profile, contact details, social links, navigation/footer links, policy notes, LocalBusiness structured data, analytics labels, and media requirements from DB-first editable settings with bundled JSON fallback. It adds validation, sync-from-bundle controls, DB/fallback diagnostics, and setting history support through `/admin-site-settings.html` and the Build 190 SQL migration.

---

## Build 191 — Editable settings hardening and live-use pass

- Fixed `/admin-site-settings.html` crash by adding `AdminAuth.guardPage()` and `AdminAuth.fetchWithAuth()` compatibility helpers and by making the page initialization defensive.
- Added structured helper fields for business profile and navigation/footer settings while keeping raw JSON available.
- Added editable setting dependency map and restore-from-history API foundations.
- Wired editable policy copy into booking, FAQ, quote-response, and quote-payment customer pages with a static fallback.
- Wired editable document templates into quote/proposal delivery plus deposit receipt/refund email queue helpers.
- Added business-hours/holiday status API and booking-page helper.
- Added analytics ingest validation against the editable analytics event registry.
- Switched Media Health JSON fallback from build-specific image requirement files to stable `data/media_requirements.json`.
- Added Build 191 release guard.

<!-- Build 192 documentation sync: editable-domain editors, restore-from-history UI, business-hours booking warnings, dynamic policies/templates, analytics registry warnings, media requirement sync/restore, and fallback diagnostics were reviewed on 2026-06-05. -->

## Build 193 documentation sync — 2026-06-05

This Markdown file was included in the Build 193 documentation sync. Build 193 fixes the Admin Social template-list 500, adds social-template fallback UI handling, strengthens editable-setting validation schemas, preserves the one-H1 SEO guard, and records that no new Supabase DDL is required for this pass.

---

## Build 194 — diff, preview, analytics quick-add, and option-library expansion — 2026-06-06

### Completed 20-step pass

1. Added `/api/admin/editable_site_settings_compare` for DB/editor versus bundled fallback JSON diffs.
2. Added visual compare controls in Editable Site Settings before force-sync or restore actions.
3. Added per-domain preview panes showing where each editable setting is used.
4. Added domain permission guidance beside each structured editor.
5. Added SEO copy-length checks for title, meta-description, H1/headline, and description-like fields.
6. Added history/fallback comparison support in the settings workflow without new database tables.
7. Added `/api/admin/analytics_registry_add_event` for one-click addition of unknown analytics events.
8. Added Admin Analytics “Add to registry” buttons on unknown event warnings.
9. Added `assets/admin-option-libraries.js` as a shared DB-first dropdown hydrator.
10. Expanded option-library dropdown usage into Admin Booking finance/status/privacy controls.
11. Expanded option-library dropdown usage into Admin Catalog stock and purchase-order controls.
12. Expanded option-library dropdown usage into Admin Leads lead, quote, draft, and media privacy status controls.
13. Fixed Admin App option-library loading to read the current `/api/site_settings_public?key=option_libraries` response shape.
14. Added business-hours warning display support to Admin Booking status saves when warning payloads are returned.
15. Added staff-auth capability aliases for `view_analytics` and `manage_settings` so analytics/settings utilities are not accidentally admin-password-only.
16. Normalized `/admin-site-settings.html` and `/admin-site-settings/` so the routed copy no longer lags behind the root page.
17. Normalized patched admin route copies for Analytics, Booking, Catalog, Leads, and App pages where route folders exist.
18. Added `sql/2026-06-06_build194_diff_preview_option_libraries_no_ddl_note.sql` documenting that no DDL is required.
19. Added `scripts/build194_diff_preview_option_libraries_check.py` and wired it into `scripts/release_check.py`.
20. Re-ran release/H1/archive checks for the packaged build.

### Next 20 recommended steps

1. Add full JSON Schema validation with field-level UI markers, not only required-path checks.

9. Add richer option-library dropdown hydration to finance, media-health, payments, content, and tax-review screens.
10. Add editable landing-page preview cards that render the actual hero, service, town, and FAQ copy.
11. Add broken-link scans for editable navigation/footer links.
12. Add local SEO proof gap reminders to the main dashboard diagnostics card.
13. Add sitemap/robots preview checks when landing-page content changes.
14. Add public structured-data preview for LocalBusiness and service landing pages.
15. Add template token previews with sample customer/booking data.
16. Add an audit export for editable-setting changes and restores.
17. Add scheduled fallback-backed settings reports for the dashboard.
18. Add media requirement diff/preview before restore-from-history.
19. Add automated smoke tests for invoice, confirmation, quote payment, booking availability, and settings APIs.
20. Continue migrating duplicated JSON/page content into DB-first editable settings where it reduces failure points.

## Build 195 documentation sync — 2026-06-06

Reviewed for Build 195. Current source of truth is the Build 195 section in `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, the gap update in `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, and the no-DDL schema note in `sql/2026-06-06_build195_schema_history_template_export_no_ddl_note.sql`.

> Build 196 documentation sync (2026-06-06): repaired the live Admin Dashboard local SEO proof 405, Admin App `esc` helper crash, and Landing Page Builder add-on fallback hydration. Schema status remains no-DDL; see `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md`, `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`, and `sql/2026-06-06_build196_admin_live_error_repairs_no_ddl_note.sql`.

---

## Build 197 documentation sync

Build 197 was reviewed during the self-healing admin diagnostics pass. Relevant implementation notes now point toward pricing catalog source/repair diagnostics, route-copy parity, independent dashboard fallback handling, landing-page SEO/readiness warnings, and continued one-H1/local-search discipline. No database DDL is required for this pass.

## Build 209 competitive sync — live-detail interaction (2026-06-17)

Current field-service/detailing products commonly emphasize mobile job photos, required checklists, customer portals, progress messaging, damage documentation, approvals, signatures, and proof of work. Build 209 advances Rosie Dazzlers in that direction with customer-now/admin-review/staff-only notes, photos, videos, protected media paths, moderation, and a customer timeline. Next differentiation should come from simple owner workflows, not enterprise complexity.

### Build 210 documentation sync — 2026-06-17

Active strategy is maintained in `AI_PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` and `MASTER_VALUE_ROADMAP.md`. This file is retained for historical, audit, specialist, or release-check context. Build 210 connects live job interaction to proof, customer decisions, payment handoff, closeout summaries, approved-media reuse, safe review requests, and the owner attention queue.

Build 211 documentation sync: retained for historical context while the active project direction remains in `AI_PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` and `MASTER_VALUE_ROADMAP.md`; production reliability, provider setup, hosted payment links, upload/retention diagnostics, and owner simplification were reviewed in this pass.

> **Build 212 documentation sync:** Active direction is maintained in `AI_PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` and `MASTER_VALUE_ROADMAP.md`. For real-world test instructions, use `docs/PRODUCTION_TEST_GUIDE.md` and `/admin-test-centre.html`; this file is retained for historical, audit, specialist, or release-check context.

## Build 213 documentation sync

Build 213 adds owner action controls in Today Needs Attention, customer price/summary acknowledgements, secure payment-link handoff, summary revision history, and booking-scoped safe interaction audit export. Active direction remains in `AI_PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` and `MASTER_VALUE_ROADMAP.md`; use `docs/PRODUCTION_TEST_GUIDE.md` for hands-on testing.

---

### Build 214 documentation sync — 2026-06-23

Build 214 prioritizes Supabase containment and owner-task reliability. The active security action is to run `sql/2026-06-23_build214_security_task_orchestration.sql`, refresh Supabase Security Advisor, and test the application through Cloudflare Functions rather than restoring direct browser access to tables. Canonical planning remains in `AI_PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` and `MASTER_VALUE_ROADMAP.md`.

### Build 216 synchronization — 2026-07-01

Build 216 synchronized this retained document with the active `AI_PROJECT_HANDOFF.md` and `MASTER_VALUE_ROADMAP.md`: public media recovery now uses bounded JPG/JPEG/WebP/PNG health checks and protected recurring alerts after its migration; DAIP remains planning-only behind the documented decision/security gates.
