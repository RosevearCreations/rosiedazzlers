# Docs Update Note

> Last synchronized: March 26, 2026. Reviewed during the booking add-on imagery, catalog autofill, low-stock reorder UI, Amazon-link intake, local SEO, and docs/schema refresh pass.

Last synchronized: March 24, 2026.

This refresh aligned the main docs to the current `dev` branch after a pass focused on:
- recovery template admin UI
- progress/jobsite moderation UI
- protected-page SEO/noindex cleanup
- schema/doc synchronization

Primary docs refreshed together:
- `README.md`
- `PROJECT_BRAIN.md`
- `CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md`
- `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`
- `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`
- `REPO_GUIDE.md`
- `SANITY_CHECK.md`
- `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md`
- handoff/next-step docs

## March 30, 2026 session-first cleanup pass
- Reduced bridge risk again by removing legacy admin fallback from another active set of endpoints, including progress posting/upload, customer-profile save/list, booking customer linking, unblock actions, and app-settings access.
- Tightened browser-side admin calls so active internal pages send `x-admin-password` only when a transitional password is actually present instead of always attaching the header shape.
- Continued doc/schema synchronization and public-page SEO/H1 review for the current build.

## March 31, 2026 docs update note
This documentation refresh syncs the repo to the current build where public catalog loaders prefer DB-backed feeds, the progress screen supports signed file upload reuse, and no new schema objects were added.
