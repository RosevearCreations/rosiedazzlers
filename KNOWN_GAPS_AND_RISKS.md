# Known Gaps and Risks — Devil n Dove

## Build 140 update — social scheduling and dry-run risks

- Dry run previews do not guarantee that a platform will accept the final API request; they are a safety preview before live publishing.
- Future-scheduled posts are blocked from API publishing early, but the queue is not yet a background scheduler. Someone still needs to run/trigger publishing after the scheduled time.
- Duplicate/repost warnings are based on a practical signature of caption, images, platforms, and link. Review before clearing because similar posts may still be intentional.
- Media warnings are URL-level checks only. Full platform media validation for aspect ratio, duration, file size, and rights still needs deeper platform-specific work.
- TikTok and YouTube remain manual/review-first until app approvals, OAuth upload handling, and media rules are fully configured.


## Build 139 update — social API publishing risks

- Social posting is now review-first plus API-capable, but credentials must be stored only in Cloudflare environment variables.
- Facebook, Instagram, X, and Pinterest can attempt publishing only when their required credentials are present.
- TikTok and YouTube remain manual/copy-ready in this pass because they require more involved upload flows and platform approval.
- The first live social tests should be done one platform at a time with harmless test captions and images.
- API failures are expected during setup and should be reviewed in Social Posting Queue attempts and Runtime Incidents instead of treated as storefront failures.

# Known Gaps and Risks

## Build 137 known gaps and risk updates

- Search Console SEO actions are recommendations only. Do not apply generated titles, meta descriptions, H1 wording, or internal links without checking the actual page intent.
- Batch delete/revert removes staged Search Console rows for that import batch. It does not change public pages, product records, or sitemap rows.
- Large Search Console imports can still grow D1 quickly. Test with a small CSV and use filters before importing a full export.
- The SEO action list now needs an export/share workflow and a current-title/current-meta comparison before it becomes a full SEO production queue.
- Product/media/accounting gaps remain: product SEO bulk tooling, media library attach/detach, Amazon bulk approval safeguards, payment application, HST review, period close/lock, and accountant export packaging.

## Build 135 known gaps and risk updates

- Product uploads now have a public URL fallback and diagnostics, but the best long-term setup is still to configure `PRODUCT_MEDIA_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://assets.devilndove.com` in Cloudflare so the setting is explicit.
- The Product editor checklist is a guidance layer; it does not replace final admin review before publishing.
- The reusable image picker uses existing `media_assets` rows. Older images pasted directly into product URL fields may not appear in the picker until they are imported into `media_assets`.
- Product Image Health samples the first missing-image and weak-alt rows, so large catalogs should still be repaired in batches.
- Edit-mode uploads now attach to the loaded product, but unassigned uploads from earlier tests may still need manual linking or cleanup.


Current sync: 2026-05-18 — Build 137 Search Console filtering, safe batch revert, and private SEO opportunity action queue.


## Build 134 product editor risk update

- The Product editor now supports true draft creation with only product name and product type required.
- SEO title, SEO description, price, category, featured image, and external listing URL are publish-readiness fields, not draft blockers.
- `/api/admin/create-product` now returns JSON on server failure and records `admin_products/create_product_failed` runtime incidents instead of allowing an HTML 500 page to produce `Unexpected token '<'` in the browser.
- The inline image uploader depends on the R2 media bucket binding and public media base URL. If those bindings are missing, the form still supports pasted image URLs and the API will return a readable JSON error.
- Remaining risk: existing-product edit mode still needs the same inline uploader workflow; use the Product Images panel or pasted URLs until that is added.

## Highest-priority gaps still open
1. The accounting backend is stronger, but it is still not a finished tax-filing system.
2. `database_upgrade_current_pass.sql` still needs to be applied in Cloudflare D1 after deployment and recorded in the migration ledger.
3. Amazon purchase review exists, but only obvious/safe rows should be approved first until more real-world review confidence is built.
4. Amazon CSV loading still needs a proper admin import screen; current staging assumes rows are already loaded into `amazon_purchase_import_staging`.
5. Cost history now exists, but inventory valuation reports still need beginning balance, additions, usage, write-offs, and ending balance logic.
6. Reconciliation exceptions now have queue statuses, but need export, attachment links, and stronger accountant review reporting.
7. Payment application screens still need to connect orders, deposits, payouts, refunds, fees, gift cards, and journals.
8. Journal validation/posting exists for monthly balance checks, but full auto-generation and close controls remain open.
9. HST/sales-tax review screens still need final worksheet/export behaviour before accountant handoff.
10. Accountant export still needs one packaged export with ledgers, statements, taxes, attachments, and unresolved notes.
11. Some catalog/product areas still use JSON as a bridge while D1 becomes the long-term source of truth.
12. Product variants/options are not complete enough for a full ecommerce app.
13. Media management still needs retire/replace/broken-link lifecycle controls.
14. Local SEO pages have been added, but they need real photos, product links, internal links from relevant pages, and performance monitoring.
15. Fuzzy Amazon matching can still be wrong when product titles are generic.

## Current guardrails
- Keep one H1 per exposed HTML page.
- Update Markdown and schema files on every code pass.
- Prefer D1 for authoritative operational data.
- Keep JSON only as fallback, seed, export, or static catalog bridge until migrated.
- Store money in cents in D1, but display dollars in admin forms.
- Treat current owned tools/supplies as at least 1 stock unit unless manually retired.
- Use package math for consumables: for example, 1 package can equal 100 sheets.
- Keep Amazon order details, costs, and review spreadsheets private; do not deploy raw order reports under public `/data/` paths.
- Review Amazon matches before applying costs; do not mass-approve weak or generic title matches.
- Run Release Sanity and D1 count checks after every deployment.

## Recently reduced risks
- Added `/api/admin/amazon-purchase-review` so private Amazon purchase staging rows can be reviewed from the admin instead of spreadsheets only.
- Added the Amazon purchase review queue UI to `/admin/catalog/` with search, status filters, approve/apply, hold, and reject controls.
- Added approved Amazon purchase application that updates linked inventory unit cost, supplier name, ASIN/supplier SKU, Amazon URL, and notes.
- Added `site_item_inventory_cost_history` so Amazon-approved costs and manual cost changes create history rows instead of silently overwriting the latest cost.
- Added inventory cost-history recording during Tools/Supplies catalog sync when a synced unit cost changes.
- Added cost-history recording for manual site-item inventory create/update and bulk cost update workflows.
- Improved the Tools/Supplies inventory sync result panel so inserted, updated, failed, Amazon URL, unit-cost, stock-default, match-status, and cost-history counts are visible after sync.
- Hardened Amazon purchase review schema creation with runtime-safe staging-table migrations for applied inventory, applied cost-history, review user, and applied timestamp fields.
- Hardened Amazon purchase review inventory access with runtime-safe inventory column backfills for older D1 tables.
- Added audit entries for Amazon purchase review decisions so approve/hold/reject actions are traceable.
- Expanded reconciliation exceptions with assign-to-user, accountant review flag, resolve, reopen, and richer status handling.
- Added reconciliation exception queue controls in the Accounting import UI for assign, manual review, accountant review, resolve, reopen, ignore, and notes.
- Added journal-period validation that checks monthly debit/credit balance before posting.
- Added journal posting metadata and posting guardrails so unbalanced monthly journals are blocked before being marked posted.
- Added Accounting report buttons for validating and posting the selected month’s journal entries.
- Added six local-intent SEO landing pages for handmade jewelry, polymer clay earrings, custom gifts, laser engraving projects, vintage finds, and workshop-made gifts in Ontario/Southern Ontario.
- Added `sitemap.xml` so the new public local-intent pages and existing public pages have a clean crawl map.
- Added shared-footer local search links so the new local-intent pages are internally linked from public pages.
- Added CSS for local-intent cards, related-page links, and mobile-friendly local page calls to action.
- Updated active schema files and Markdown files, then ran syntax/H1/meta/link sanity checks for the new build.

## Build 126 runtime warning follow-up

- The Release Sanity warning for recent runtime errors is now actionable from `/admin/operations/` through the new Security / Runtime Incidents panel.
- The warning should not be treated as a deploy blocker by itself; it means unresolved `error` or `critical` incidents were logged in the last 7 days.
- Main risk: if the same scope/code/endpoint group repeats, the underlying API or schema drift still needs a code or D1 fix.
- Resolved or ignored rows are excluded from the warning, so do not mark rows closed until the recurring cause has been reviewed.


## Build 127 runtime incident follow-up

- The `/api/products` runtime incident group was caused by schema drift assumptions in the public products endpoint.
- A key example is `COALESCE(tc.rate_percent, tc.tax_rate, 0)`: D1/SQLite still fails when `tc.rate_percent` does not exist, even if `tc.tax_rate` does.
- Build 127 reduces this risk by inspecting table columns before building SQL and by using a schema-adaptive product-only fallback.
- Remaining risk: if the live `products` table itself is missing or unreadable, `/api/products` will still return a safe empty result and log an incident.
- After deployment, old `/api/products` incident rows should be marked resolved only after fresh requests stop creating new rows.

## Build 128 products API follow-up

- Build 127 still allowed `p.merchandise_origin` to leak into a live `/api/products` query on the deployed D1 schema.
- Build 128 treats `PRAGMA table_info` as helpful but not authoritative; optional columns are now verified with a direct `SELECT column FROM table LIMIT 0` test before being referenced.
- The public product list fallback now avoids all newer optional storefront fields and supplies safe defaults instead.
- `/api/product-detail` was also hardened because product detail used several of the same newer product, tax, and SEO columns.
- Remaining risk: if the live `products` table lacks required basics like `slug`, `product_id`, or `name`, public product results may still be empty or product detail may return a schema-unavailable response.
- Long-term fix: apply/verify the full product schema migration so merchandise origin, sale channel, external listing fields, condition/era/sourcing notes, and current tax fields exist in D1.


## Build 129 reduced risks

- Added a visible D1 Schema Drift Report so missing live D1 columns can be found before public APIs fail.
- Added Public API Health checks for shop/product/catalog endpoints after deployment.
- Release Sanity now includes a product schema drift snapshot and `/api/products` health check.
- Runtime incidents can now be cleaned up only after they are resolved/ignored and old enough to be safe to remove.
- Amazon CSV rows can now be imported into private D1 staging from admin rather than placing private import files in public static folders.
- Amazon review rows now explain match confidence using status, score, ASIN presence, inventory link, and available unit cost.

## Build 129 remaining risks

- The Amazon CSV import is intentionally simple and review-first; it still needs duplicate detection before large imports.
- Amazon staging import does not automatically match new rows to inventory yet unless the CSV already includes inventory keys.
- Public API Health depends on the deployed host being reachable from the Worker runtime; if fetch self is blocked/noisy, use direct browser checks too.
- Schema Drift Report lists missing columns but does not run migrations automatically.
- Runtime incident cleanup permanently deletes old resolved/ignored records, so export important history first if needed.

## Build 130 products API risk update

- The `/api/products` incident count increased again after the prior compatibility patch, which proved the endpoint still had a path that could reference optional product columns or log incidents before a successful lower-tier fallback.
- Build 130 removes candidate optional columns from the verified SQL column set and adds a final `SELECT *` fallback that filters in JavaScript. This is intentionally less fancy but much harder for schema drift to break.
- The only time `/api/products` should now log a new error incident is when every product query tier fails, including `SELECT * FROM products`.
- If the endpoint returns `summary.authority: "d1_select_star_fallback"`, the storefront is protected, but D1 schema cleanup is still recommended.
- Old `/api/products` incidents should remain open until a fresh deploy is verified, then they can be marked resolved.

## Build 131 known gaps and risk updates

- Storefront Schema Repair can add safe missing columns, but it does not replace the need for a reviewed full D1 migration history. Use it as a compatibility repair, then record/confirm the migration ledger.
- `/api/products` should no longer be allowed to sit at `authority: "error"`. If the endpoint falls back to `d1_select_star_fallback`, the public storefront is protected but schema cleanup is still recommended.
- Product rows may still need value backfills after columns are added: `merchandise_origin`, `sale_channel`, `currency`, `requires_shipping`, `status`, and image fields should be reviewed before relying on filters.
- The new local predeploy sanity script catches obvious public data leaks, but private Amazon order/cost files still must not be placed under `/data/` or other public static folders.
- Public API Health now checks more endpoints, but it cannot validate real buyer checkout success; payment/provider tests remain a separate workflow.
- Next risk to reduce: product schema value backfill and product structured-data checks so richer shop filters and SEO can move from fallback-safe to fully intentional.

## Build 132 known gaps and risk updates

- The mobile main menu is now grouped and expandable, but it still needs a real-phone pass after deployment because mobile browser address bars and font scaling can affect drawer height.
- If an old cached `/js/main.js` or `/css/styles.css` remains in the browser, the menu may still look like the older long list. Hard refresh or clear site cache before judging the deployed result.
- The mobile drawer is a code/CSS fix only. No D1 schema change is required, but the Build 132 marker should still be recorded so the release ledger remains complete.
- Admin department shortcut buttons now scroll horizontally on small screens; future work should add a dedicated admin mobile command palette if the admin page count keeps growing.
- The next major risk is still D1/product schema drift and accounting workflow completeness, not the menu itself.

## Build 133 known gaps and risk updates

- Structured Data Health is a diagnostic layer, not a guarantee that Google will show rich results. It helps catch missing/invalid JSON-LD and Product-readiness fields before pages are submitted or crawled.
- Live Sitemap Preview does not overwrite the static `sitemap.xml` yet. It gives a live D1 product URL preview so the next pass can decide whether to regenerate static XML or move to a dynamic sitemap route.
- Storefront Value Backfill is intentionally conservative. It fills blank defaults and creates missing `product_seo` placeholder rows, but it does not invent product descriptions, prices, or images.
- Search Console tables are staging-only. The actual CSV import screen and charts are still pending.
- The mobile menu should remain compact from Build 132, but deployed phones should still be checked after cache clears.

## Build 136 known gaps and risk updates

- Search Console CSV import is manual and staging-only. It does not connect to Google Search Console directly and should be tested with a small export first.
- Imported Search Console rows can accumulate quickly. A delete/revert batch action and date filters should be added before large recurring imports.
- SEO opportunity rows are hints, not automatic edits. Review the actual page intent before changing titles, meta descriptions, H1 wording, or internal links.
- The Search Console staging tables are private D1 tables. Do not place Search Console CSV exports under public `/data/` folders.
- The next highest SEO value is turning imported opportunities into a simple page-level action list with suggested title/meta/internal-link improvements.


## Build 138 update — social posting queue risk posture

- Social posting is now review-first and manual/copy-ready, not blind auto-posting.
- Direct API posting remains a known future gap because Facebook/Instagram/TikTok/X require platform apps, OAuth tokens, scopes, and in some cases app review or paid API access.
- Platform secrets must stay in Cloudflare environment variables, not D1, Markdown, JSON, or public site files.
- Next risk-reduction step: add per-platform connection diagnostics before any live API publish action is enabled.


## Build 141 update — social queue gaps moved forward

Completed: the social queue now has reusable caption templates, a compact content calendar summary, content pillars, calls to action, and UTM-tagged links for review-first crafting/process posts.

Remaining gaps:
- Social caption templates are seeded by code and not yet fully editable from an admin template editor.
- TikTok and YouTube remain manual/review-first until their upload flows, permissions, media rules, and app approvals are configured.
- Social API credentials must stay in Cloudflare environment variables only; do not store tokens in D1, Markdown, JSON, or public files.
- UTM links are generated, but analytics rollups from those UTM campaigns still need a reporting panel.
- Customer/job-media privacy controls still need a dedicated “do not post” guard before job/customer images can be selected for social posts.


## Build 142 update — Competitive roadmap completed and tracked

- Completed `COMPETITIVE.md` as the active competitive strategy for Devil n Dove, covering positioning, homepage/product-page improvements, mobile UX, local SEO, social workflow, marketplace readiness, product media, trust, and accounting/margin direction.
- Added Operations > Competitive Roadmap so the highest-value items from the document can be seeded into D1, assigned a status, and reviewed during Release Sanity.
- Added `competitive_opportunities` and `competitive_opportunity_events` schema support.
- Added `/data/site/competitive-opportunities.json` as a public-safe roadmap seed file; it contains strategy/action metadata only and no private costs, orders, or customer data.
- Next direction: connect competitive opportunities to product readiness, SEO action completion, social analytics, testimonials, custom requests, and marketplace export checks.


## Build 142 competitive roadmap risks

- `COMPETITIVE.md` is now more complete, but it is still a strategy document. Public page copy, product rendering, media requirements, and admin workflows need to be implemented step by step.
- Operations > Competitive Roadmap seeds strategy items into D1, but marking an item `done` should only happen after the related public/admin behavior is verified.
- The public-safe `data/site/competitive-opportunities.json` must remain strategy-only. Do not place competitor scraping exports, private costs, Amazon order rows, customer names, or platform credentials in public data folders.
- Social platform directions remain review-first. Direct posting still depends on platform credentials, scopes, app review, and platform-specific media rules.
- X API cost/rate-limit changes can make API publishing less practical than manual/copy mode; keep manual posting as a fallback.
- Competitive tracking should not distract from accounting completeness: payment application, HST review, close controls, and accountant export remain important business-risk items.


## Build 143 update — social privacy guard risks reduced

- Reduced risk of accidental public posting of customer details, private workshop background information, visible bystanders, or overly personal captions.
- Social API publishing now blocks unless the queue item is privacy-approved or marked as product-only/no-private-media.
- Default privacy rules are seeded in D1 and visible in Operations > Social Media Privacy Guard.
- Remaining risk: this is an admin review workflow, not image-recognition. Someone still needs to inspect the media before approving it.
- Next risk reduction: add customer/job consent records and connect media assets to a “safe for social” flag.
