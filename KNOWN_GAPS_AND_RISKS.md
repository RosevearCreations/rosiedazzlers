# Known Gaps and Risks — Build 151

**Updated:** 2026-05-18

## Reduced in this pass

- Admin Catalog now has a media-library-aware image picker path through `/api/admin/media_library_list`.
- The picker can search DB media rows, app-setting media rows, bundled consumables/tools fallback rows, saved DB inventory rows, and helper image URLs.
- Staff can select inventory rows and use **Repair selected images** to persist fallback-matched images instead of only seeing temporary UI hydration.
- Browser-side **Scan visible images** can flag image URLs that fail to load during the current admin session.
- Duplicate-image groups are counted in the quality summary and shown on affected rows.
- Release checks now guard the media-library picker, selected image repair, duplicate diagnostics, image health scan, and endpoint markers.
- Schema tracking now includes the Build 151 `app_media_library` table/index baseline.

## Still open

1. The media-library endpoint can read `app_media_library`, but the table still needs to be seeded from the actual R2 product/tool folders.
2. Admin Catalog can pick existing media URLs, but it does not yet upload new files directly to R2.
3. Browser image scans are useful for staff checks, but they are not a scheduled/server-side 404 monitor yet.
4. Duplicate-image warnings do not yet have an approval/ignore list for intentional duplicate tools, multipacks, or shared product photos.
5. `Repair selected images` is intentionally conservative; a fuller review screen is still needed for repairing all fallback-matched rows at once.
6. Existing DB rows with blank images are hydrated visually, but the URL is only persisted after save or selected repair.
7. Supabase dev still needs the Build 150 and Build 151 SQL migrations applied and smoke-tested.
8. External location photos are still placeholders and should be replaced with Rosie-owned/R2-hosted images.
9. Reviews, before/after proof, and inventory/tool stories are not yet automatically filtered by town/service page.
10. Inventory/accounting still needs stock-count sessions, variance review, receipt attachment, and lockable month-end inventory valuation.
11. Search Console and Google Business Profile reporting are not yet connected.
12. Some historical Markdown snapshots remain for traceability, but active docs are the Build 151 working handoff source.
