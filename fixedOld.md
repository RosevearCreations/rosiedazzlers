# Build 184 update — 20-step operations, media, and payment hardening

**Updated:** 2026-06-01  
**Build:** 184

Build 184 completes the requested next-20 pass by tightening the payment/refund operations, improving image/media readiness review, and documenting the next operational bundle. This pass is intentionally no-DDL: it uses the existing Build 180–182 payment tables and the Build 183 image requirements foundation.

## Build 184 — 20 completed items

1. Added `/admin-media-health.html` and `/admin-media-health/` so staff can review missing required photos/videos from a protected admin page.
2. Added `/api/admin/media_asset_health_scan` to scan required public R2/media URLs and return missing/not-public files with upload keys.
3. Added `data/image_requirements_build184.json` as the machine-readable source for required app, add-on, landing, gallery, and proof images.
4. Added the Media Health page to the shared Admin Menu.
5. Added Media Health access rules to `assets/admin-auth.js`.
6. Added a Media Health card to the Admin Dashboard.
7. Added `/api/admin/payment_refund_status_poll` so staff can poll Stripe/PayPal refund status and refresh local refund rows.
8. Added `/api/admin/payment_receipt_resend` so staff can requeue a customer quote-deposit receipt email from a payment request.
9. Added `/api/admin/payment_accountant_package_export` for an accountant-style payment CSV with Ontario HST allocation estimates.
10. Added an **Export accountant package** button to Admin Payments.
11. Added **Resend receipt** controls to quote deposit/payment request cards.
12. Added **Poll provider status** controls to refund record cards.
13. Kept manual refund records, provider refund initiation, webhook settlement, and replay controls on one Payments page for easier review.
14. Added `sql/2026-06-01_build184_twenty_step_ops_media_payment_no_ddl_note.sql` to document the no-DDL Build 184 schema status.
15. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` with Build 184 operational notes.
16. Updated `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md` with the Build 184 no-DDL dependency summary.
17. Updated `IMAGES.md` with the Admin Media Health scan workflow and upload review method.
18. Updated `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md` to reflect Build 184 media/payment/accounting hardening.
19. Added `scripts/build184_twenty_step_ops_media_payment_check.py` and wired it into the release check chain.
20. Re-ran the one-H1 and release guard path so exposed public pages still use one clear H1.

## Next 20 steps after Build 184

1. Deploy Build 184 and test `/admin-media-health.html` against live R2 assets.
2. Upload the missing add-on images listed in `IMAGES.md`, then re-run the Media Health scan.
3. Replace regional landing placeholders with Rosie-owned images for Tillsonburg, Woodstock/Ingersoll, Simcoe/Delhi, Port Dover, Norwich/Otterville, and Waterford/Vittoria.
4. Capture the first four approved-public before/after gallery proof sets by town/service.
5. Add real image dimension validation instead of URL-only health checks.
6. Add R2 signed upload URLs for admin media replacement so uploads can happen from the app instead of the Cloudflare dashboard only.
7. Add a media task status table so missing-image items can be assigned, marked uploaded, reviewed, and approved.
8. Add provider refund polling for payment requests without refund rows, not only existing refund records.
9. Add scheduled retry checks for pending Stripe/PayPal refunds.
10. Add payment reconciliation variance warnings for paid amount vs. quote/deposit amount.
11. Add processor fee capture and estimated net payout fields to the payment export.
12. Add HST/GST allocation review screens before accountant export is considered final.
13. Add failed receipt email retry controls and visible notification-event status on Admin Payments.
14. Add customer-facing receipt PDF/download links.
15. Add final-balance invoice/payment requests after job completion.
16. Add payment application to final invoices, deposits, refunds, and tips.
17. Add month-end payment close checklist tied to reconciled provider exports.
18. Add dashboard warnings for missing images on high-traffic public pages.
19. Add Search Console/local SEO task cards tied to missing service/town proof content.
20. Add a consolidated accountant export package that bundles payment CSV, refund CSV, journal candidates, HST summary, and close checklist.

# Build 171 documentation sync note

**Updated:** 2026-05-24

This Markdown file was reviewed during the Build 171 pass. Current source of truth remains `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`. Build 171 adds the Admin Leads quote-starter workflow and no new DDL.

---
<!-- refreshed 2026-04-25: block-range town-page pass -->
> Documentation synchronized April 23, 2026: live vehicle-size SVG guide, App Management chart preview/download helper, no-DDL schema sync, and continued public SEO/static-check direction.

> Last synchronized: April 14, 2026. Reviewed during the App Management checkbox-alignment repair, package family/size-price clarification pass, pricing catalog UI polish, and docs/schema synchronization pass.

## 2026-04-13 Pass 14 Sync
- Booking screen remains stable and should not be altered in future passes unless a critical bug appears.
- `_redirects` is working and treated as complete for the current route layout.
- Pricing/packages/add-ons/service areas/travel charges continue to flow through the App Management pricing control center as the preferred single entry point.
- This pass added office-facing finance adjustments for discounts/refunds plus customer-facing document work for order confirmation, invoice / summary, gift certificate printing, and social feed management.

> Pass sync April 15, 2026: generated local price-chart PNG assets from the canonical bundled pricing catalog, rewired chart fallbacks to `/assets/brand`, added a regeneration script, and refreshed docs/schema notes for the legacy price-image carry-forward pass.

Pass sync (2026-04-15): price references now use the generated local pricing charts, a local vehicle size chart was added, booking/job usage logs no longer reduce stock on hand automatically, and inventory now supports finished / defective / write-off stock actions for reorder and accounting follow-up.
- Pass sync 2026-04-16 (pass 21): added crew time/payroll workflow, staff availability blocks, payroll runs + accounting-post option, staff pay/work-cap settings, and service-time insight reporting; booking screen remains stable.

- Pass 22 sync: fixed admin-accounting date/input layout, moved admin-staff to a left-side internal menu layout, normalized admin login redirects to .html, and added clean admin route rewrites for payroll/staff/accounting/app/login.

---

## Pass 24 Sync — 2026-04-17

This pass focused on three areas:
- normalized the shared top admin navigation and repaired the off-pattern `admin-assign` header so the top menu matches the other admin screens more closely
- shifted the public self-serve direction back to a booking-led planner on the pricing page by embedding the live booking experience so customers keep the exact service-area restrictions, 21-day availability windows, slot logic, and booking aesthetics instead of using a separate quote-builder path
- continued the scheduled e-gift direction by exposing public growth settings, improving the gift message/send-date experience, and adding live recipient/delivery preview boxes on the gifts page

Schema impact for this pass: no new tables or columns. Existing `app_management_settings` is reused for public quote, e-gift, and membership display settings.

Pass sync: April 17, 2026 — pricing now restores the booking page as the first self-serve step by embedding the live booking planner on /pricing so service-area restrictions, 21-day availability windows, add-on logic, and booking aesthetics stay in one source of truth.
- 2026-04-17 pass26: extended booking-led self-serve with live embedded planner summaries on pricing and service-gift redemption preview, plus richer gift delivery metadata (sender name, preferred send date, message) through checkout, webhook, receipt, and printable certificate.

### April 17, 2026 pass27 note
- moved the next public growth step forward with a new `/maintenance-plan` page, recurring-plan waitlist capture, admin visibility for recurring reminder candidates, and stronger booking-link carry-forward from the live embedded planner.



<!-- pass29-sync: customer-history recurring maintenance reminders -->


> Pass sync April 20, 2026: customer screen raw JSON blocks were replaced with readable summaries and a visual garage layout, App Management social feeds gained a structured editor with the raw JSON moved into an advanced block, booking-led maintenance interest now requires Complete Detail selection before schedule interest capture, and customer-facing print/email correspondence styling was refined.


<!-- pass31-sync: booking overflow polish, maintenance conversion from complete detail, fleet handoff path -->
> Pass sync April 20, 2026: booking vehicle inputs and service cards were tightened to prevent text overflow, My Account now uses a real garage-bay view plus a fleet handoff path after 6 vehicles, and maintenance conversion now begins only after a completed Complete Detail with repeat-booking guidance tied to actual service history.

> Pass sync April 21, 2026: added mileage and next-service mileage capture, customer vehicle image/video library groundwork, garage-bay photo support, a public before/after slider gallery, admin vehicle-media override/delete tools, and detailer arrival geolocation capture groundwork.

## 2026-04-22 doc sync

- reviewed during the merchandising / SEO / geofence refinement pass
- no file-specific workflow changes were required beyond the centralized roadmap, schema, repo-guide, and handoff updates

## Pass 27 sync — 2026-04-24
- Fixed the `/api/admin/block_date` and `/api/admin/block_slot` save paths so they work with the current legacy `date_blocks(blocked_date)` and `slot_blocks(blocked_date, slot)` schema instead of writing non-existent `updated_at` columns.
- Added shared admin shell CSS for `.app-shell`, `.surface-grid-2`, `.toolbar-wrap`, and `.pill-grid`, which repairs the stretched internal menu layout on `admin-live.html` and moves `admin-blocks.html` into the same left-menu shell pattern.
- Tightened form-control CSS so admin date inputs, text boxes, and wrapped button rows stop overlapping; `admin-accounting.html` now uses more resilient auto-fit grids for filter, entry, and remittance controls.
- Expanded analytics reporting so `admin-analytics.html` now shows daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly traffic rollups with CSV export buttons, all generated from `site_activity_events` without adding a new reporting table in this pass.
- No new database migration was required in this pass. `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` was refreshed to document that schedule blocks still use the legacy `blocked_date` / `slot` shape and that analytics reports are computed from `site_activity_events` at request time.

## Build 151 synchronization note

Updated 2026-05-18: active implementation moved to Admin Catalog media-library image picker support, selected-row image repair, duplicate-image diagnostics, browser image-health scan, `app_media_library` schema tracking, and continued local SEO/H1/CSS release discipline. See `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, and `SANITY_CHECK.md` for the current working plan.

## Build 152 synchronization note

Reviewed during the 2026-05-18 Cloudflare Pages Functions deploy hotfix. No content-specific workflow change was required here; active handoff/schema docs carry the detailed Build 152 notes.

## Build 153 synchronization note

Reviewed during the 2026-05-19 Cloudflare Pages Functions import-path hotfix. No document-specific workflow change was required here; active handoff, roadmap, sanity, and schema docs carry the detailed Build 153 notes.

## Build 156 sync note - social progress publishing

Build 156 adds a reviewable social publishing foundation. Admin Progress can now create internal social drafts from job updates/media, Admin Social Queue can review and mark those drafts, and the schema now includes `social_channels`, `social_post_queue`, and `social_dispatch_attempts`. Direct posting to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, and other platforms is possible later after the required platform credentials, app approvals, and consent/compliance checks are in place.

---

## Build 161 sync note

Build 161 keeps `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` as the source of truth and advances the competitor-aligned conversion path with Booking service chooser guidance, package aliases, and photo-estimate CTAs.

---
> Build 174 documentation sync (2026-05-24): persistent quote/proposal drafts were added to Admin Leads with save/load APIs, SQL table foundation, schema notes, and release guard coverage. Quote starters remain copy-ready before the SQL is applied, but saved drafts require sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql.


## Build 175 update — lead conversion, pricing suggestions, content expansion, gallery privacy, and analytics

- Added safe lead → draft booking/quote conversion using `public.lead_conversion_drafts` instead of creating live scheduled bookings too early.
- Added catalog-backed package/add-on price suggestions for Admin Leads from the current pricing catalog.
- Added quote draft status workflow controls: draft, needs review, ready to send, sent, accepted, declined, archived.
- Expanded Admin Content Center beyond FAQ with reusable content blocks for specials, service blurbs, homepage cards, help articles, trust proof, fleet, and maintenance copy.
- Added service/town filtering for the public before/after gallery and enforced public reuse only for approved-public/sample media.
- Added FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion analytics summary endpoint for admin reporting.
- Added SQL/schema sync in `sql/2026-05-25_build175_lead_conversion_content_gallery_analytics.sql`.

## Build 176 Update — conversion-to-booking, dashboard cards, and privacy warnings

- Added a reviewed conversion draft → real booking workflow so Admin Leads can create a live booking only after staff confirms service date, AM/PM slot, address, package, vehicle size, customer name, and customer email.
- Added Admin Analytics cards for FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion summary using `/api/admin/conversion_funnel_summary`.
- Added App Management media privacy readiness warnings using `/api/admin/media_privacy_review_summary` so gallery/social reuse is checked before publishing.
- Preserved the one-H1 exposed-page rule and kept local SEO wording/access paths focused on Oxford/Norfolk service discovery.
- Added Build 176 SQL/schema notes for `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_booking_id` and `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_at`.
> Build 177 documentation sync (2026-05-25): added protected conversion-draft review queue, catalog-backed final price reconciliation, local SEO proof coverage reporting, public gallery privacy badges, SQL/schema notes, and release guard coverage.


> Build 178 documentation sync (2026-05-25): conversion status saves, saved final price reviews, public content rendering, privacy badges, and proof recommendation work were reflected in the active docs/schema notes.

---

## Build 179 documentation sync — publish blocking, proof tasks, quote acceptance

Build 179 adds hard social publish blocking before webhook/API/manual posted actions, assignable local SEO proof tasks from proof recommendations, and customer-facing quote/proposal delivery plus accept/decline tracking. Schema tracking now points to `sql/2026-05-26_build179_publish_block_tasks_quote_acceptance.sql`. The one-H1 SEO rule, local service/town wording, and fallback-safe API pattern remain required on every pass.

---

### Build 180 update — accepted quote deposit/payment request and final booking confirmation

Build 180 connects the accepted quote workflow to a safer payment-request foundation. Staff can create a tracked deposit/payment request from an accepted quote/proposal draft, share the private `/quote-payment.html` customer page, mark deposits paid from Admin Leads, and link or confirm the final booking when a booking row is available. Schema tracking was updated for `public.quote_deposit_payment_requests` and the quote/conversion deposit status fields.
---

> Build 181 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added verified Stripe/PayPal webhook settlement for `quote_deposit_payment_requests`, PayPal quote-deposit order/capture support, automatic deposit-paid updates, booking confirmation linking, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard and local service/town wording rules remain required on every pass.

> Build 182 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added quote-deposit webhook event history, verified-event replay controls, customer receipt email queueing, manual/provider refund and partial-refund tracking, `/admin-payments.html`, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, and Markdown/schema synchronization remain required on every pass.

---

## Build 183 documentation sync — direct refunds, reconciliation export, webhook warnings, and image requirements

Build 183 adds direct Stripe/PayPal refund initiation from Admin Payments, a payment reconciliation CSV export, dashboard/payment-page warnings for failed or unverified webhook events, and a cleared/rebuilt `IMAGES.md` with missing image/video requirements and upload methods. This build is no-DDL and depends on the Build 180–182 payment tables. SEO/H1, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, schema tracking, and Markdown synchronization remain required on every pass.
