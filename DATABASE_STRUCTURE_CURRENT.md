# Build 165 sync — Booking photo-estimate link capture

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 165 adds optional `public.bookings.photo_estimate_links` jsonb storage plus a public Booking Step 4 photo-estimate link field, sends the links through checkout, stores them in notes as a fallback, writes to optional `bookings.photo_estimate_links` when migrated, and shows clickable links in Admin Booking intake review. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

# Build 164 sync — booking intake review fields

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 164 adds optional booking review fields through `sql/2026-05-22_build164_booking_intake_review_actions.sql`: `intake_review_note`, `intake_reviewed_at`, and `intake_reviewed_by`. These support the Admin Booking photo-estimate, condition-review, and media/privacy review action controls. The workflow remains fallback-safe before migration by appending staff review status to booking notes.

# Build 163 sync — booking intake admin review

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

Build 163 adds fallback-safe direct booking intake field storage and a staff-facing Admin Booking panel for estimate intake, condition-helper recommendations, media-consent preference, and privacy-review status hints. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

# Build 161 database/schema note

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

No DDL was added in Build 161. The package aliases and recommendation fields are content metadata in the pricing catalog. When the DB-first catalog is refreshed, carry these fields into `app_management_settings.pricing_catalog`; no table migration is required for this pass.

# Build 158 update — Social review gates and local caption templates

**Updated:** 2026-05-20  
**Current build:** Build 158

Build 158 continues the Build 156/157 social publishing workflow and makes it safer before any job/crafting-progress photo or summary is pushed to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, or manual/webhook channels.

5. Confirm `Publish/API` is blocked until `Approve & ready` is clicked.
6. Add a duplicate-content warning in the Admin Social Queue UI using `duplicate_signature`.
7. Add a template picker that loads `social_caption_templates` from the DB.
8. Add a hashtag preset picker that loads `social_hashtag_presets` from the DB.
9. Add a scheduler calendar for planned posting times.
10. Add a posted URL capture form for manual posts.
11. Add customer-facing consent capture on the booking/progress flow.
12. Add media-crop/blur status fields for license plates and private identifiers.

# Database Structure Current — Build 157


**Build 157 update — 2026-05-19:** Social progress publishing bridge added. Admin Progress can automatically create social drafts and optionally attempt approved API/webhook posting. Admin Social Queue now supports Publish/API, Send webhook, Copy text/media, Ready, Mark posted, and Skip. No DDL is required beyond Build 156; Build 157 adds `sql/2026-05-19_build157_social_api_publish_bridge_no_ddl_note.sql`.


**Updated:** 2026-05-18

## Inventory/media tables in active use

### `catalog_inventory_items`

Current inventory source of truth for saved tools and consumables. Important fields include:

- `item_key`, `item_type`, `name`, `category`, `subcategory`
- `image_url`, `amazon_url`, Amazon match enrichment fields
- `qty_on_hand`, `reorder_point`, `reorder_qty`, `unit_label`, `cost_cents`
- `preferred_vendor`, `vendor_sku`, `receipt_url`, `assigned_station`
- `service_tags`, `reuse_policy`, `is_public`, `is_active`

### `catalog_inventory_movements`

Tracks stock usage, manual adjustments, waste/write-off actions, and booking-linked inventory movement.

### `catalog_purchase_orders`

Tracks reorder requests, ordered/received status, reminder dates, purchase URL, vendor, quantity, and receive lifecycle.

### `app_media_library`

Build 151 DB-backed shared media-library target. Used by `/api/admin/media_library_list` and Admin Catalog image picker when available.

Important fields:

- `media_key`, `label`, `media_type`, `media_url`, `fallback_url`
- `alt_text`, `caption`, `group_key`, `usage_contexts`
- `recommended_size`, `source_status`, `sort_order`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`

## Fallback order

1. Saved DB rows in `catalog_inventory_items`.
2. `app_media_library` rows for picker/search if available.
3. `app_management_settings.media_library` rows if the table is not populated yet.
4. Bundled JSON product/tool rows from `data/rosie_products_catalog.json` and `data/systems_catalog.json`.
5. Browser-local helper image URLs.

## Build 151 migration

Apply:

```sql
sql/2026-05-18_build151_media_library_inventory_image_workflow.sql
```

This migration is non-destructive and safe to apply before the media library is populated.

## Build 155 schema note

Build 155 is a deploy hotfix and release-check hardening pass. It does not add or change database tables. The current schema remains Build 151 plus the Build 150 inventory image indexes.

<!-- Build 155 sync 2026-05-18 -->

## Build 155 schema note

Build 155 has no database DDL. The schema remains the Build 151 media-library baseline plus Build 150 inventory image indexes. This pass only repairs Cloudflare Pages Functions import resolution and deploy checks.


## Build 155 Cloudflare root import release-check hotfix - 2026-05-18

Build 155 repairs the remaining root Cloudflare Pages Function import paths that could still break deployment after Build 154. Four root `/functions/api/*.js` files still used `../_lib/...`; root routes must use `./_lib/...`. Build 155 fixes those files, keeps the stale-route shims, wires the stale-root import guard into the release checklist, and updates the release runner so the full check can complete in this sandbox.

No database shape changed in Build 155. Active DB baseline remains Build 150 inventory image indexes plus Build 151 `app_media_library`.

## Build 156 sync note - social progress publishing

Build 156 adds a reviewable social publishing foundation. Admin Progress can now create internal social drafts from job updates/media, Admin Social Queue can review and mark those drafts, and the schema now includes `social_channels`, `social_post_queue`, and `social_dispatch_attempts`. Direct posting to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, and other platforms is possible later after the required platform credentials, app approvals, and consent/compliance checks are in place.

Database note: run `sql/2026-05-19_build156_social_progress_dispatch_queue.sql` before relying on live social queue writes.

## Build 159 sync — social queue usability and release discipline

- Added caption/hashtag DB picker support for Admin Social Queue.
- Added planned publish time for manual drafts and schedule filtering.
- Added duplicate draft warnings using `duplicate_signature`.
- Added manual posted URL and platform post ID capture.
- Added `social_post_metrics_snapshots` schema support for future reporting.
- Release checks now require the Build 159 social template/schedule markers.
