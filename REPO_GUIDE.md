### `/data`
Canonical/fallback static content such as:
- `rosie_services_pricing_and_packages.json`
- gear/consumables/system catalog JSON
- site feature content

### `/functions/api`
Key groupings:
- booking / availability / gifts / payments
- admin booking/staff/customer tools
- progress / jobsite / moderation
- recovery / analytics / notifications
- public catalog feed

### `/sql`
Ordered migration history. New SQL should be additive and keep `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` synchronized.

## Preferred direction rules
- Prefer token-based progress over legacy/simple progress paths.
- Prefer DB-backed public catalog data with safe JSON fallback.
- Prefer role-aware/staff-aware endpoints over older bridge-style ones.
- Prefer additive changes over destructive rewrites.
- Keep protected/admin/token pages out of search indexing.
