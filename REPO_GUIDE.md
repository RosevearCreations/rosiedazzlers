14. Added `social_caption_templates` table.

18. Added `duplicate_signature` on queued posts to support future duplicate-content warnings.
19. Updated social workflow release checks for Build 158 markers.
20. Updated Markdown and schema notes for the new social review gate.

## Next 20 value-added steps after Build 158

1. Apply the Build 156 social queue migration if it has not already been run.

3. Test Admin Progress with one internal job update and one media URL.
4. Confirm a draft is created with platform warnings in Admin Social Queue.
5. Confirm `Publish/API` is blocked until `Approve & ready` is clicked.
6. Add a duplicate-content warning in the Admin Social Queue UI using `duplicate_signature`.
7. Add a template picker that loads `social_caption_templates` from the DB.
8. Add a hashtag preset picker that loads `social_hashtag_presets` from the DB.
9. Add a scheduler calendar for planned posting times.
10. Add a posted URL capture form for manual posts.
11. Add customer-facing consent capture on the booking/progress flow.
12. Add media-crop/blur status fields for license plates and private identifiers.

15. Add basic post analytics fields: clicks, views, likes, comments, shares, and last checked time.
16. Add webhook payload signing/verification documentation for Make/Zapier/n8n bridges.
17. Add scheduled retry rules for failed webhook/API attempts.
18. Add a public gallery promotion workflow that only uses approved social media rows.
19. Add Google Business Profile post/manual workflow notes once the account flow is finalized.

<!-- Build 152 sync 2026-05-18 -->

## Build 153 synchronization note

Reviewed during the 2026-05-19 Cloudflare Pages Functions import-path hotfix. No document-specific workflow change was required here; active handoff, roadmap, sanity, and schema docs carry the detailed Build 153 notes.

## Build 156 sync note - social progress publishing

Build 156 adds a reviewable social publishing foundation. Admin Progress can now create internal social drafts from job updates/media, Admin Social Queue can review and mark those drafts, and the schema now includes `social_channels`, `social_post_queue`, and `social_dispatch_attempts`. Direct posting to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, and other platforms is possible later after the required platform credentials, app approvals, and consent/compliance checks are in place.

---

## Build 161 sync note

Build 161 keeps `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` as the source of truth and advances the competitor-aligned conversion path with Booking service chooser guidance, package aliases, and photo-estimate CTAs.

---
> Build 174 documentation sync (2026-05-24): persistent quote/proposal drafts were added to Admin Leads with save/load APIs, SQL table foundation, schema notes, and release guard coverage. Quote starters remain copy-ready before the SQL is applied, but saved drafts require sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql.


## Build 175 update — lead conversion, pricing suggestions, content expansion, gallery privacy, and analytics

- Added safe lead → draft booking/quote conversion using `public.lead_conversion_drafts` instead of creating live scheduled bookings too early.
- Added catalog-backed package/add-on price suggestions for Admin Leads from the current pricing catalog.
- Added quote draft status workflow controls: draft, needs review, ready to send, sent, accepted, declined, archived.
- Expanded Admin Content Center beyond FAQ with reusable content blocks for specials, service blurbs, homepage cards, help articles, trust proof, fleet, and maintenance copy.
- Added service/town filtering for the public before/after gallery and enforced public reuse only for approved-public/sample media.
- Added FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion analytics summary endpoint for admin reporting.
- Added SQL/schema sync in `sql/2026-05-25_build175_lead_conversion_content_gallery_analytics.sql`.

## Build 176 Update — conversion-to-booking, dashboard cards, and privacy warnings

- Added a reviewed conversion draft → real booking workflow so Admin Leads can create a live booking only after staff confirms service date, AM/PM slot, address, package, vehicle size, customer name, and customer email.
- Added Admin Analytics cards for FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion summary using `/api/admin/conversion_funnel_summary`.
- Added App Management media privacy readiness warnings using `/api/admin/media_privacy_review_summary` so gallery/social reuse is checked before publishing.
- Preserved the one-H1 exposed-page rule and kept local SEO wording/access paths focused on Oxford/Norfolk service discovery.
- Added Build 176 SQL/schema notes for `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_booking_id` and `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_at`.
> Build 177 documentation sync (2026-05-25): added protected conversion-draft review queue, catalog-backed final price reconciliation, local SEO proof coverage reporting, public gallery privacy badges, SQL/schema notes, and release guard coverage.


> Build 178 documentation sync (2026-05-25): conversion status saves, saved final price reviews, public content rendering, privacy badges, and proof recommendation work were reflected in the active docs/schema notes.

## Build 179 documentation sync — publish blocking, proof tasks, quote acceptance

Build 179 adds hard social publish blocking before webhook/API/manual posted actions, assignable local SEO proof tasks from proof recommendations, and customer-facing quote/proposal delivery plus accept/decline tracking. Schema tracking now points to `sql/2026-05-26_build179_publish_block_tasks_quote_acceptance.sql`. The one-H1 SEO rule, local service/town wording, and fallback-safe API pattern remain required on every pass.

---

### Build 180 update — accepted quote deposit/payment request and final booking confirmation

Build 180 connects the accepted quote workflow to a safer payment-request foundation. Staff can create a tracked deposit/payment request from an accepted quote/proposal draft, share the private `/quote-payment.html` customer page, mark deposits paid from Admin Leads, and link or confirm the final booking when a booking row is available. Schema tracking was updated for `public.quote_deposit_payment_requests` and the quote/conversion deposit status fields.
---

> Build 181 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added verified Stripe/PayPal webhook settlement for `quote_deposit_payment_requests`, PayPal quote-deposit order/capture support, automatic deposit-paid updates, booking confirmation linking, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard and local service/town wording rules remain required on every pass.
