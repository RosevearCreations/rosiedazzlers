# Build 181 handoff note — verified provider quote deposits

Build 181 adds verified Stripe/PayPal webhook settlement for accepted quote deposit/payment requests. Apply `sql/2026-05-26_build181_payment_webhooks_quote_deposits.sql` after Build 180, then test Stripe Checkout metadata settlement and PayPal verified capture settlement through `quote_deposit_payment_requests`.

# Build 178 update — Status Saves, Saved Price Reviews, Public Content Rendering & Privacy Badges

**Current build:** Build 178  
**Date:** 2026-05-25

Build 178 closes the next operational gaps after Build 177 by adding conversion-draft status saving, saved final price reviews, live rendering of Admin Content Center blocks on public pages, media privacy readiness badges in the Social Queue/App Management flow, and deeper local SEO proof recommendations. No new DDL is required; this pass depends on the Build 175 content/conversion tables and Build 177 final-price review fields.

## Completed in Build 178

1. Added `/api/admin/lead_conversion_status_save` so staff can move conversion drafts through `draft_booking`, `needs_review`, `ready_to_book`, `converted`, and `closed`.
2. Added `/api/admin/lead_conversion_price_review_save` so catalog reconciliation results can be saved before booking creation.
3. Updated `/admin-conversions.html` with Save Status and Save Price Review controls.
4. Added `/assets/public-content-blocks.js` and live public content mounts on Home, Services, Specials, Fleet, Maintenance, and Help pages.
5. Added Social Queue media privacy readiness badges using the existing media privacy summary endpoint.
6. Expanded local SEO proof reporting with concrete next-proof recommendations by town/service.
7. Added a Build 178 release guard and no-DDL SQL note.

## Updated completion status after Build 178

| Area | Status | Build 178 notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conversion draft status workflow | Stronger foundation | Status can now be saved without creating a booking. |
| Final price reconciliation | Stronger foundation | Reconciliation can be saved before booking creation. |
| Admin Content public rendering | Added foundation | DB/fallback content blocks can now render on public pages. |
| Media privacy before reuse | Stronger foundation | Social/Admin flows now show privacy readiness reminders. |
| Local SEO proof reporting | Stronger foundation | Report now recommends next town/service proof to create. |

## Remaining priority after Build 178

1. Add a fuller conversion-draft detail page with audit history.
2. Render saved content blocks into exact page sections rather than only generic cards.
3. Add admin approval gates that block publish/API actions unless consent and privacy statuses are approved.
4. Turn proof recommendations into assignable content/media tasks.
5. Add quote/proposal email delivery and customer acceptance tracking.

# Build 177 update — Conversion Review Queue, Price Reconciliation & Local Proof Reporting

**Updated:** 2026-05-25  
**Current build:** Build 177  
**Primary source of truth:** `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

Build 177 closes the next workflow gap after Build 176 by adding a dedicated `/admin-conversions.html` review queue. Staff can now review all lead conversion drafts in one place, reconcile final package/add-on/travel/HST pricing from the pricing catalog, confirm the required booking fields, and create a live booking only after the draft is ready. Build 177 also adds local SEO proof reporting that counts only privacy-approved before/after examples by town and service.

## Completed in Build 177

1. Added `/admin-conversions.html` and `/admin-conversions/` as a protected conversion-draft review queue.
2. Added `/api/admin/lead_conversion_price_reconcile` for catalog-backed package/add-on/travel/HST/deposit review before booking creation.
3. Added `/api/admin/local_seo_proof_report` for privacy-approved town/service proof coverage reporting.
4. Updated Admin Analytics with a **Local SEO proof coverage** card.
5. Updated public Gallery cards with clearer consent/privacy badges.
6. Added optional final-price review fields to `public.lead_conversion_drafts` via `sql/2026-05-25_build177_conversion_review_price_local_proof.sql`.
7. Updated Admin Dashboard, Admin Menu, Admin Shell, and Admin Leads access paths so the Conversion Queue is easy to find.
8. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`, `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md`, and release guards.

## Updated completion status after Build 177

| COMPETETIVE.md area | Current status | Build 177 notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lead → booking workflow | Stronger foundation | Dedicated review queue now separates draft review from the lead card UI. |
| Final price reconciliation | Added foundation | Catalog-backed package/add-on/travel/HST review is available before creating a real booking. |
| Quote/booking status workflow | Improved | Conversion drafts can be filtered/reviewed before becoming live booking rows. |
| Admin-managed content | Partial but improved | FAQ and reusable content blocks exist; page-specific live rendering remains next. |
| Service/town proof reporting | Added foundation | Analytics now reports approved proof coverage by target town/service. |
| Media privacy enforcement | Improved | Public Gallery shows consent/privacy badges and still filters non-approved media. |
| Conversion analytics | Improved | Lead/quote summary exists and local proof coverage was added to Admin Analytics. |

## Remaining competitive gap priority after Build 177

1. Save final price reconciliation payloads directly from `/admin-conversions.html` before booking creation.
2. Add a dedicated conversion-draft status update endpoint for `needs_review`, `ready_to_book`, `converted`, and `closed`.
3. Add visible privacy badges beside every admin gallery/social publish action, not only public gallery and App Management warnings.
4. Render Admin Content Center blocks live on public Specials, service, homepage, fleet, maintenance, and Help pages.
5. Add town/service proof dashboards that recommend the next local page or gallery item to create.
6. Add customer-facing quote/proposal send and acceptance tracking.

# Build 174 update — Admin Leads quote/proposal drafts

**Updated:** 2026-05-24  
**Current build:** Build 174  
**Primary source of truth:** `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

Build 174 completes the next open competitive-matrix item after the quote starter: staff can now save generated quote starter text as a persistent quote/proposal draft from `/admin-leads.html`. This moves the workflow from copy-only follow-up toward a real quote pipeline while staying fallback-safe if the new table has not been applied yet.

## Completed in Build 174

1. Added `/api/admin/quote_proposal_drafts_save` for staff-protected quote/proposal draft creation and updates.
2. Added `/api/admin/quote_proposal_drafts_list` for staff-protected draft lookup by lead, booking, status, search, or id.
3. Updated `/admin-leads.html` and `/admin-leads/index.html` with **Save quote draft** and **Load drafts** actions on each public lead.
4. Added persistent draft display directly under the lead card so staff can see saved follow-up text before contacting a customer.
5. Added migration-safe fallback messages when the new draft table has not been applied yet.
6. Added SQL migration `sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql`.
7. Updated `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` and `DATABASE_STRUCTURE_CURRENT.md` with the quote/proposal draft table plan.
8. Added release guard `scripts/quote_proposal_drafts_build174_check.py` and wired it into `scripts/release_check.py`.
9. Re-ran Cloudflare Functions checks, one-H1 validation, and release checks.

## Active next steps after Build 174

1. Apply `sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql` after the Build 167/168 lead SQL.
2. Browser-test `/admin-leads.html` by building a quote starter, saving it as a draft, and loading it again.
3. Add draft status controls for `needs_review`, `ready_to_send`, `sent`, `accepted`, and `declined`.
4. Add one-click lead → draft booking/quote conversion.
5. Add package/add-on price suggestions from the live pricing catalog.
6. Extend Admin Content Center to specials, service blurbs, homepage cards, and help articles.
7. Add service/town-aware proof filtering and media privacy enforcement before public gallery/social use.

# Rosie Dazzlers Build 173 note — Admin Content Center and Help Articles access

**Updated:** 2026-05-24

Build 173 adds a protected Admin Content Center at `/admin-content.html` for FAQ editing, with new protected endpoints `/api/admin/content_faqs_list` and `/api/admin/content_faqs_save`. It also expands `/blog` into a real Help Articles hub and exposes it from the public navigation as **Help**. This pass requires no new database table, but live FAQ saves require the Build 172 `public_faq_entries` SQL migration.

---
> Build 173 documentation sync (2026-05-24): Admin Content Center, FAQ editor APIs, expanded Help Articles access/content, public Help nav link, and schema no-DDL note were updated. See `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md`, and `SANITY_CHECK.md` for the active plan.

> Build 172 documentation sync (2026-05-24): Public FAQ page/content access, `/api/public_faqs`, `public_faq_entries` SQL foundation, sitemap/nav/footer links, and competitive-matrix status were updated. See `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, and `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md` for the active plan.

# Rosie Dazzlers Build 171 note — Admin lead quote starter

**Updated:** 2026-05-24

Build 171 continues the public-lead/photo-estimate workflow by adding a protected Admin Leads quote-starter action. Staff can open `/admin-leads.html`, click **Build quote starter** on a public lead, and receive copy-ready internal quote text built from the lead, customer message, photo/share links, linked uploads, privacy status, and staff checklist. No new DDL is required for this pass; apply Build 167 and Build 168 SQL for live lead/upload data.

---
# Rosie Dazzlers Build 168 note

Build 168 adds the protected Admin Leads & Photo Estimates workflow for reviewing `public_inquiry_leads` and `photo_estimate_uploads`. Apply Build 167 SQL, then Build 168 SQL before relying on live lead/upload data.

---

# Build 167 update

Build 167 note: Adds public fleet/maintenance lead forms, optional quote-photo upload foundation, FAQPage/Breadcrumb schema foundations, and SQL for public_inquiry_leads/photo_estimate_uploads.

---

# Build 166 README update

**Updated:** 2026-05-23

Build 166 attempts to complete the public-facing items from `COMPETETIVE.md` by adding public routes for specials, gift cards, fleet, maintenance, and education, expanding the add-on catalog, adding sticky CTAs, updating Services/Homepage routing, and documenting status in `COMPETETIVE_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md`. `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` remains the source of truth.


---

# Build 165 sync — Booking photo-estimate link capture

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 165 adds a public Booking Step 4 photo-estimate link field, sends the links through checkout, stores them in notes as a fallback, writes to optional `bookings.photo_estimate_links` when migrated, and shows clickable links in Admin Booking intake review. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 164 sync — Admin booking intake review actions

**Updated:** 2026-05-22

Build 164 adds staff action controls to Admin Booking for photo-estimate status, condition-review status, media/privacy status, privacy checklist flags, blur/crop flags, and a staff intake-review note. The action writes directly to optional booking fields when the Build 162/163/164 migrations are applied and falls back to booking notes if the optional columns are not live yet. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 163 sync — booking intake admin review

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

Build 163 adds fallback-safe direct booking intake field storage and a staff-facing Admin Booking panel for estimate intake, condition-helper recommendations, media-consent preference, and privacy-review status hints. Continue from `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, which remains the source of truth.

---

# Build 162 note — booking condition helper

Build 162 adds a booking condition helper, photo-estimate request flag, and media-consent preference in the public booking flow. Run the Build 162 SQL migration after prior migrations if direct DB fields are desired; checkout remains safe before that migration because it writes the new intake details into existing booking notes.

---

# Build 161 sync — README.md

**Updated:** 2026-05-21

The current website/app now has competitor-aligned service chooser coverage on Services and Booking, clearer public package aliases, and a Contact-page photo-estimate path. Build 161 is a no-DDL pass; the new package metadata is JSON/catalog content and should be copied into the DB-managed pricing catalog when the live catalog is refreshed.

---

# Build 160 sync — competitor sanity and roadmap reset

**Updated:** 2026-05-21  
**Current build:** Build 160

Build 160 reviewed `COMPETETIVE.md` against the current website/app and reset `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` as the top implementation source of truth. The project is strong on local pages, services/pricing/booking, gallery/recent work, admin workflows, social queue, and release checks. The next priority is public conversion clarity: service chooser guidance, package aliases, photo-estimate CTAs, FAQ/proof expansion, consent/media privacy gates, and DB-first admin content management.

Key Build 160 files: `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`, `COMPETITOR_SANITY_CHECK.md`, `COMPETETIVE.md`, `KNOWN_GAPS_AND_RISKS.md`, `services.html`, `services/index.html`, `scripts/competitor_roadmap_check.py`, and `sql/2026-05-21_build160_competitor_sanity_roadmap_no_ddl_note.sql`.

# Build 158 update — Social review gates and local caption templates

**Updated:** 2026-05-20  
**Current build:** Build 158

Build 158 continues the Build 156/157 social publishing workflow and makes it safer before any job/crafting-progress photo or summary is pushed to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, or manual/webhook channels.

18. Added `duplicate_signature` on queued posts to support future duplicate-content warnings.
19. Updated social workflow release checks for Build 158 markers.
20. Updated Markdown and schema notes for the new social review gate.

## Next 20 value-added steps after Build 158

1. Apply the Build 156 social queue migration if it has not already been run.
2. Apply `sql/2026-05-20_build158_social_review_gates_and_templates.sql`.
3. Test Admin Progress with one internal job update and one media URL.
4. Confirm a draft is created with platform warnings in Admin Social Queue.
5. Confirm `Publish/API` is blocked until `Approve & ready` is clicked.
6. Add a duplicate-content warning in the Admin Social Queue UI using `duplicate_signature`.
7. Add a template picker that loads `social_caption_templates` from the DB.

# Rosie Dazzlers Dev Build — Build 157


**Updated:** 2026-05-19

## Build 157 focus

- Social publishing bridge for job/crafting process photos and summaries.
- Admin Progress can create social drafts after update/media posts.
- Optional immediate API/webhook publishing attempt after draft creation.
- Admin Social Queue now includes Publish/API, Send webhook, Copy text/media, Mark posted, Ready, and Skip actions.
- X, Facebook Page, and Instagram Business API attempts are wired behind environment variables.
- TikTok, Google Business Profile, LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, and unsupported platforms remain safe webhook/manual fallbacks.
- SEO/H1 and Cloudflare Pages Functions release checks remain active.



**Updated:** 2026-05-18

This ZIP is the current dev baseline for Rosie Dazzlers.

## Build 155 focus

- Cloudflare Pages Functions deploy hotfix for `media_library_list.js`.
- Landing page public API duplicate object-key cleanup.
- Release-check hardening for deploy-only JavaScript issues.
- Admin Catalog inventory media-library picker foundation.
- Staff-protected `/api/admin/media_library_list` endpoint.
- Selected-row image repair for fallback-matched inventory images.
- Duplicate image diagnostics.
- Browser image health scan for visible inventory rows.
- Schema and Markdown synchronization.
- Continued SEO/H1/CSS release checks.

## Important files

- `SANITY_CHECK.md`

## Release check

```bash
python scripts/release_check.py
```

## Deploy note

Apply SQL migrations in order. If `app_media_library` is not seeded yet, Admin Catalog should keep working from app settings and bundled product/tool image fallbacks. Build 155 should also avoid the prior Cloudflare deploy regex failure.

<!-- Build 155 sync 2026-05-18 -->

## Build 155 focus

Build 155 is a Cloudflare Pages Functions deploy hotfix. It repairs unresolved `_lib` imports in root API route files, preserves the media-library image workflow from Build 151/152, keeps the duplicate landing-page key cleanup, and adds import-resolution checking to the deploy-safety script. No database DDL is required.

## Build 155 Cloudflare stale root function shim hotfix - 2026-05-19

Cloudflare still saw older flat `/functions/api/*.js` route files after GitHub web uploads, because uploading ZIP contents does not reliably delete older files from the branch. Build 155 intentionally includes compatibility shim files for the stale flat routes listed in the Cloudflare deploy log. Each shim re-exports the active `/functions/api/admin/*.js` implementation and prevents Pages Functions bundling failures while preserving the newer admin route implementation.

Next step: after Build 155 deploys cleanly, optionally remove the compatibility shims in a clean-branch/orphan rebuild so only the intended folder-backed route files remain.


## Build 155 Cloudflare root import release-check hotfix - 2026-05-18

Build 155 repairs the remaining root Cloudflare Pages Function import paths that could still break deployment after Build 154. Four root `/functions/api/*.js` files still used `../_lib/...`; root routes must use `./_lib/...`. Build 155 fixes those files, keeps the stale-route shims, wires the stale-root import guard into the release checklist, and updates the release runner so the full check can complete in this sandbox.

Important Build 155 files: `functions/api/blocks_range_save.js`, `functions/api/catalog_amazon_matches.js`, `functions/api/catalog_bulk_import.js`, `functions/api/catalog_bulk_visibility.js`, `scripts/cloudflare_pages_functions_check.py`, `scripts/stale_root_function_shims_check.py`, `scripts/release_check.py`, and `sql/2026-05-18_build155_cloudflare_root_import_release_check_no_ddl_note.sql`.

## Build 156 sync note - social progress publishing

Build 156 adds a reviewable social publishing foundation. Admin Progress can now create internal social drafts from job updates/media, Admin Social Queue can review and mark those drafts, and the schema now includes `social_channels`, `social_post_queue`, and `social_dispatch_attempts`. Direct posting to X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google Business Profile, and other platforms is possible later after the required platform credentials, app approvals, and consent/compliance checks are in place.


## Build 159 sync — social queue usability and release discipline

- Added caption/hashtag DB picker support for Admin Social Queue.
- Added planned publish time for manual drafts and schedule filtering.
- Added duplicate draft warnings using `duplicate_signature`.
- Added manual posted URL and platform post ID capture.
- Added `social_post_metrics_snapshots` schema support for future reporting.
- Release checks now require the Build 159 social template/schedule markers.

## Build 169 deployment note

This build repairs live auth/API 500 behavior seen on `/login` and `/admin-leads.html`. Deploy the files, then verify Cloudflare Pages has `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set. Confirm the Supabase auth/session tables exist before testing staff/client login. `auth_me` and analytics should now return safe JSON fallbacks instead of browser-visible 500s.
Build 169 adds `scripts/auth_analytics_build169_check.py` and wires it into `scripts/release_check.py`.

## Build 170 deployment note

Build 170 repairs the remaining signed-out customer dashboard console noise found after Build 169. `/api/client/dashboard` now returns a safe HTTP 200 JSON payload with `ok:false`, `authenticated:false`, and `code:"not_authenticated"` when no valid customer session exists. This keeps public booking/account helpers from reporting a failed network resource while preserving authorization on protected customer write endpoints.

Build 170 adds `scripts/client_dashboard_build170_check.py` and wires it into `scripts/release_check.py`. No database DDL is required; see `sql/2026-05-24_build170_customer_dashboard_signed_out_fallback_no_ddl_note.sql`.

## Build 172 handoff note

- New customer FAQ/help route: `/faq` and `/faq/index.html`.
- Access paths: top nav, footer, homepage, Services, Pricing, Contact, and sitemap.
- New FAQ DB/API foundation: `public_faq_entries`, `/api/public_faqs`, `data/site_faqs.json`.
- Next recommended build: Admin Content editor for FAQ/special/service/education copy, then persistent quotes and lead conversion.

---
> Build 174 documentation sync (2026-05-24): persistent quote/proposal drafts were added to Admin Leads with save/load APIs, SQL table foundation, schema notes, and release guard coverage. Quote starters remain copy-ready before the SQL is applied, but saved drafts require sql/2026-05-24_build174_quote_proposal_drafts.sql.


## Build 175 update — lead conversion, pricing suggestions, content expansion, gallery privacy, and analytics

- Added safe lead → draft booking/quote conversion using `public.lead_conversion_drafts` instead of creating live scheduled bookings too early.
- Added catalog-backed package/add-on price suggestions for Admin Leads from the current pricing catalog.
- Added quote draft status workflow controls: draft, needs review, ready to send, sent, accepted, declined, archived.
- Expanded Admin Content Center beyond FAQ with reusable content blocks for specials, service blurbs, homepage cards, help articles, trust proof, fleet, and maintenance copy.
- Added service/town filtering for the public before/after gallery and enforced public reuse only for approved-public/sample media.
- Added FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion analytics summary endpoint for admin reporting.
- Added SQL/schema sync in `sql/2026-05-25_build175_lead_conversion_content_gallery_analytics.sql`.

## Build 176 Update — conversion-to-booking, dashboard cards, and privacy warnings

- Added a reviewed conversion draft → real booking workflow so Admin Leads can create a live booking only after staff confirms service date, AM/PM slot, address, package, vehicle size, customer name, and customer email.
- Added Admin Analytics cards for FAQ/help/lead/quote conversion summary using `/api/admin/conversion_funnel_summary`.
- Added App Management media privacy readiness warnings using `/api/admin/media_privacy_review_summary` so gallery/social reuse is checked before publishing.
- Preserved the one-H1 exposed-page rule and kept local SEO wording/access paths focused on Oxford/Norfolk service discovery.
- Added Build 176 SQL/schema notes for `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_booking_id` and `lead_conversion_drafts.converted_at`.

### Build 176 release note

Build 176 adds the next operations bridge: Admin Leads can now turn reviewed conversion drafts into live booking rows after required details are confirmed. Admin Analytics includes conversion summary cards, and Admin App warns about gallery/upload media that is not public-ready.
> Build 177 documentation sync (2026-05-25): added protected conversion-draft review queue, catalog-backed final price reconciliation, local SEO proof coverage reporting, public gallery privacy badges, SQL/schema notes, and release guard coverage.


> Build 178 documentation sync (2026-05-25): added conversion status saving, saved final price reviews, public content block rendering, media privacy badges, proof recommendations, schema note, and release guard coverage.

---

## Build 179 documentation sync — publish blocking, proof tasks, quote acceptance

Build 179 adds hard social publish blocking before webhook/API/manual posted actions, assignable local SEO proof tasks from proof recommendations, and customer-facing quote/proposal delivery plus accept/decline tracking. Schema tracking now points to `sql/2026-05-26_build179_publish_block_tasks_quote_acceptance.sql`. The one-H1 SEO rule, local service/town wording, and fallback-safe API pattern remain required on every pass.

---

### Build 180 update — accepted quote deposit/payment request and final booking confirmation

Build 180 connects the accepted quote workflow to a safer payment-request foundation. Staff can create a tracked deposit/payment request from an accepted quote/proposal draft, share the private `/quote-payment.html` customer page, mark deposits paid from Admin Leads, and link or confirm the final booking when a booking row is available. Schema tracking was updated for `public.quote_deposit_payment_requests` and the quote/conversion deposit status fields.
---

> Build 181 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added verified Stripe/PayPal webhook settlement for `quote_deposit_payment_requests`, PayPal quote-deposit order/capture support, automatic deposit-paid updates, booking confirmation linking, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard and local service/town wording rules remain required on every pass.

> Build 182 documentation sync (2026-05-26): Added quote-deposit webhook event history, verified-event replay controls, customer receipt email queueing, manual/provider refund and partial-refund tracking, `/admin-payments.html`, SQL/schema tracking, and release guard coverage. The one-H1 SEO guard, local service/town wording, fallback-safe APIs, and Markdown/schema synchronization remain required on every pass.
